Special celebration after!</p>
<p>Three great talks!</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Wiley </strong><br />
Making Your Own Mobile Phone for Fun and Privacy</p>
<p>Brandon will be talking about the open source hardware mobile phone project being developed by his non-profit, the Operator Foundation. It&#8217;s a phone that anyone can build easily. Building your own phone pulls back the veil of mystery that we attribute to these magical devices. You also know exactly what your phone is doing, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about tracking, hacking, or leaking of your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Darling </strong><br />
Superhuman Strength with a Shoestring Budget&#8230; and Perhaps Actual Shoestrings</p>
<p>There is a lot of work ongoing in strength-enhancing exoskeletal systems in various corporations and universities, but the strategy is almost universally to build a wearable robot, analogous to the Iron Man suit of comics and movies. Such suits have a number of drawbacks, with tremendous power demand being the major concern. There are, however, alternative approaches that mimic biology, requiring much less power and leveraging the natural advantages of mammalian anatomy. I&#8217;ll discuss how much stronger human muscle is than most people realize, how your muscle fibers do it, and how we can use some of these biological tricks to build cheap, elegant, strength-enhancing exoskeletons with extremely low power demand.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Smith </strong><br />
How to start an apparel business</p>
<p>With 15 years of industry experience in tech and a wealth of knowledge in user-centered design, what&#8217;s the best way to take advantage of all that? Why, move into a completely different industry and start an apparel business, of course! Laura will be talking about everything you always wanted to know pursuing your passion in life!</p>

<p><strong>I Got No Strings: Puppeteer Removal through Machine Learning on a Social Robot</strong><br />
<strong> by Brad Knox</strong></p>
<p>Brad will talk about research at MIT, where he and others investigated whether robots can be effectively programmed for autonomous social interaction through a machine-learning method called &#8220;learning from demonstration&#8221;. In this case, the method involves learning from Wizard-of-Oz teleoperation, in which the robot&#8217;s human interaction partner is unaware of the human puppeteer. To test this technique—Learning from the Wizard— it was used to create an autonomous robot that acts as a playful learning companion for young children. Brad will share what he did and what was learned.</p>
<p>Brad Knox is prototyping tiny, lifelike toy robots, which he hopes are coming soon to a home (many homes!) near you. Before that, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the MIT Media Lab, computer science PhD student at UT Austin, and an undergrad studying psychology at Texas A&amp;M University. His research spanned machine learning, human-robot interaction, and psychology, with a focus on machine learning algorithms that learn through human interaction.</p>
<p><strong>The Music Machine </strong><br />
<strong> by Mickey Delp</strong></p>
<p>Mickey Delp will show and talk about the creation of his new MUSIC MACHINE, a walk up and play music device created to show people of all ages, with very little instruction, how to create music and change sounds. The Music Machine made its debut at the 2015 SXSW Create event: <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F03%2F17%2F198258%2Fmickey-delp-makes-walk-up-and-play-electronic-instruments-video&amp;h=rAQEK9aod&amp;enc=AZOyoKwXqiagjRpgcWbBi3-MkYx_0kZaIchU1wx2vZFDypupaZ0ce__SVR-qvGOQS_Y&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://<wbr />entertainment.slashdot.org/<wbr />story/15/03/17/198258/<wbr />mickey-delp-makes-walk-up-a<wbr />nd-play-electronic-instrum<wbr />ents-video</a></p>
<p><strong>DAR-1</strong><br />
<strong> by Ray Renteria</strong></p>
<p>Ray will show and talk about his interactive robot, DAR-1, which was shown at the Robot Petting Zoo during SXSW: <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fmar%2F16%2Frobots-torture-sxsw&amp;h=fAQFMD1Fg&amp;enc=AZOIHWd3M_guqP5c6dQQti4XvnQUE8hbgd_yqkS21l9mGFVhRQEBcZ5sMZxYUj9QaxE&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://<wbr />www.theguardian.com/<wbr />technology/2015/mar/16/<wbr />robots-torture-sxsw</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/peterandrewflynn" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=1667074100">Peter Flynn</a> will be presenting about how to use a telephone pick-up coil (designed for recording phone calls) to translate the electromagnetic fields coming off of everyday electronics into eerie sounds. Including a little background on the strange former rules against connecting devices to AT&amp;T’s network that led to the development of Rube Goldberg type inventions like the telephone pick-up coil in the first place. Peter is a Midwesterner by birth but Austin resident by choice since 1992. Works as a computer support specialist at UT by way of a degree in English. A film fanatic who watches several hundred films each year and gleefully attends festivals like Fantastic Fest and SXSW Film. All of which have nothing to do with the subject he will be talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/vine311" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=628264141">Jason Vines</a> will be showing a super cool robotic character he created for a film project! Jason is an actor, improviser, singer, web designer and special effects makeup artist living and working in Austin, Texas. He’s been dabbling in special effects for the past 8 years and has created creatures both fantastic and disgusting for Halloween, haunts, stage and screen. He also really likes bacon. Please visit his website at <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.113fx.com%2F&amp;h=tAQH1tk42&amp;enc=AZPtPdnRtehlwPt7R2qBpfqMDBatZxPOFHFtzzP9ejEHbLxFiQp4cLLjKWyWNcmFkuI&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.113fx.com</a> to see what else he has done!</p>
<p>Clint Young is a local artist who will be presenting the process of how he comes up with a design! Clint’s illustrations reflect everything he finds wonderful about storytelling and childhood imagination. Father, husband, writer and illustrator of children’s books and adventurous stories. Clint has worked on multiple Star Wars titles as visual effect / conceptual artist, and currently he resides as a senior concept artist in Austin, TX. <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cgyoung.com%2F&amp;h=nAQGWIYLk&amp;enc=AZNBs52vz-3GPZdraez7oEDwIizj5jGKPQzs1o3BEkYifCUOK79Q2FMoTC0yYPltcDU&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.cgyoung.com</a></p>

<h2>Farming Seaweed in Austin, Texas: the Tech Below the Surface</h2>
<p><strong>Lewis Weil (You know. From Nerd Nite!)</strong></p>
<p>Austin, Texas is home to the only inland culinary seaweed farm in North America. Lewis will for the first time give a public presentation on the technology that makes my farm possible. Weil&#8217;s seaweed is on plates in fancy restaurants, has been featured on Slashdot, and every bit of it used to be grown in his garage. It is now in a greenhouse at an urban farm in south Austin.</p>
<p>Lewis Weil talks about aquariums way too much. He has a real job and other interests and stuff. But given alcohol and a chance the conversation always turns to growing things in water. He has kept everything from microscopic algae, rare amazon fish, delicate corals, and sharks. He tries to maintain a façade of being a cool human being. All his best ideas start out as jokes.</p>
<h2>Naturalistic Paludariums 101</h2>
<p><strong>Wiley Wiggins (You know. From Juegos Rancheros and other stuff!)</strong></p>
<p>This is the story of a normal person who never planned on building enormous microcontroller-regulated biotopes in his home. The acquisition of a cute and unassuming amphibian friend started a slow decent down the hobby hole towards madness. Learn how to create rainforest zones within glass boxes in your own home, all watched over by machines of loving grace.</p>
<p>Wiley Wiggins is one of the organizers of the Juegos Rancheros indie videogame meetup, monthly at the North Door. You may know him from other stuff as well.</p>
<h2>Under the C&#8217;s: Lessons Learned In The Trenches of a Library</h2>
<p><strong>Dustin Younse (our Current-and-soon-to-be-Former Dorkbot Overlord)</strong></p>
<p>Libraries are more than just a collection of assorted, dusty books, and recent advances in technology have highlighted the role of the library as a repository of knowledge, not a repository of paper, ink and glue. We&#8217;ll take a quick look at some of the cool stuff happening right now, and in the near future.</p>
<p>Dustin is the Overlord of Dorkbot Austin, was, until recently, the Webmaster for the University of Texas Libraries, and is one heck of a cat dad, according to his ward Audrey.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dorkbot is &#8211; As ALWAYS &#8211; a FREE and ALL AGES event.</p>
