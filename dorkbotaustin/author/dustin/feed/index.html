Halloween-o-rama is nearly upon us! This October, our Dorkbot meeting will be Halloween themed, costumes optional, but strongly encouraged! We are being hosted this month by the generous folks at the Austin Hackerspace on the north end of town. Be sure to check out their website for location details and more info about their excellent new space.</p>
<p>We are still looking for both short and long presentations to join a few excellent guests who have already signed on.  As a special treat, we will be raffling off a lighted fabric belt we hope will serve as inspiration and a source of parts for an excellent craft based project.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers so far:</strong><br />
<strong>Jonathan Leistiko &amp; Sharon Cichelli</strong> &#8211; how to cast your face for more mask-making possibilities<br />
<strong>Laura Smith</strong> &#8211; This 2-person costume I made with my Lilypad Arduino just so I could talk about it at Dorkbot<br />
<strong>Lindsey Greene of The Dead Left</strong> &#8211; Bass distortion boxes with fun LEDs<br />
More to come!</p>
<p>More info and speaker announcements as we have the details, so stay tuned <img src='http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotaustin/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First and foremost, for those that have not heard, Dorkbot Austin is under new management.  Our good friend Nick Pietraniec has accepted an exciting new job offer packing up his family and soldering irons to seek his fortune in the Pacific Northwest.  We wish him the best of luck on his journey!</p>
<p>Secondly, our September meeting!  This will take place Monday September 20th, 7pm &#8211; 10pm in the ACTLab (Studio 4B of the CMB building) at UT.  The building is located at the SE corner of Guadalupe and Dean Keaton (26th Street).</p>
<p>Facebook Event: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=147003611998758" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=147003611998758</a></p>
<p>We are going to try a bit of a different format for the meeting, and are currently seeking presenters.  Please contact me at milsyobtaf [at] gmail [dot] com to put your hat in the ring.  We would like to welcome the traditional 20-30 minute presentation / discussion format of (mostly) finished projects as well as bring in shorter 5-10 minute presentations of projects that are in progress or even in the planning stages.  Need to brainstorm past a roadblock or seek help from the community?  These shorter presentations are for you!</p>
<p>Questions or concerns?  Don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know.</p>
