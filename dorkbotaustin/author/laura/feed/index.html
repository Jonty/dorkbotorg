<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/peterandrewflynn" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=1667074100">Peter Flynn</a> will be presenting about how to use a telephone pick-up coil (designed for recording phone calls) to translate the electromagnetic fields coming off of everyday electronics into eerie sounds. Including a little background on the strange former rules against connecting devices to AT&amp;T’s network that led to the development of Rube Goldberg type inventions like the telephone pick-up coil in the first place. Peter is a Midwesterner by birth but Austin resident by choice since 1992. Works as a computer support specialist at UT by way of a degree in English. A film fanatic who watches several hundred films each year and gleefully attends festivals like Fantastic Fest and SXSW Film. All of which have nothing to do with the subject he will be talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/vine311" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=628264141">Jason Vines</a> will be showing a super cool robotic character he created for a film project! Jason is an actor, improviser, singer, web designer and special effects makeup artist living and working in Austin, Texas. He’s been dabbling in special effects for the past 8 years and has created creatures both fantastic and disgusting for Halloween, haunts, stage and screen. He also really likes bacon. Please visit his website at <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.113fx.com%2F&amp;h=tAQH1tk42&amp;enc=AZPtPdnRtehlwPt7R2qBpfqMDBatZxPOFHFtzzP9ejEHbLxFiQp4cLLjKWyWNcmFkuI&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.113fx.com</a> to see what else he has done!</p>
<p>Clint Young is a local artist who will be presenting the process of how he comes up with a design! Clint’s illustrations reflect everything he finds wonderful about storytelling and childhood imagination. Father, husband, writer and illustrator of children’s books and adventurous stories. Clint has worked on multiple Star Wars titles as visual effect / conceptual artist, and currently he resides as a senior concept artist in Austin, TX. <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cgyoung.com%2F&amp;h=nAQGWIYLk&amp;enc=AZNBs52vz-3GPZdraez7oEDwIizj5jGKPQzs1o3BEkYifCUOK79Q2FMoTC0yYPltcDU&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.cgyoung.com</a></p>

<h2>Farming Seaweed in Austin, Texas: the Tech Below the Surface</h2>
<p><strong>Lewis Weil (You know. From Nerd Nite!)</strong></p>
<p>Austin, Texas is home to the only inland culinary seaweed farm in North America. Lewis will for the first time give a public presentation on the technology that makes my farm possible. Weil&#8217;s seaweed is on plates in fancy restaurants, has been featured on Slashdot, and every bit of it used to be grown in his garage. It is now in a greenhouse at an urban farm in south Austin.</p>
<p>Lewis Weil talks about aquariums way too much. He has a real job and other interests and stuff. But given alcohol and a chance the conversation always turns to growing things in water. He has kept everything from microscopic algae, rare amazon fish, delicate corals, and sharks. He tries to maintain a façade of being a cool human being. All his best ideas start out as jokes.</p>
<h2>Naturalistic Paludariums 101</h2>
<p><strong>Wiley Wiggins (You know. From Juegos Rancheros and other stuff!)</strong></p>
<p>This is the story of a normal person who never planned on building enormous microcontroller-regulated biotopes in his home. The acquisition of a cute and unassuming amphibian friend started a slow decent down the hobby hole towards madness. Learn how to create rainforest zones within glass boxes in your own home, all watched over by machines of loving grace.</p>
<p>Wiley Wiggins is one of the organizers of the Juegos Rancheros indie videogame meetup, monthly at the North Door. You may know him from other stuff as well.</p>
<h2>Under the C&#8217;s: Lessons Learned In The Trenches of a Library</h2>
<p><strong>Dustin Younse (our Current-and-soon-to-be-Former Dorkbot Overlord)</strong></p>
<p>Libraries are more than just a collection of assorted, dusty books, and recent advances in technology have highlighted the role of the library as a repository of knowledge, not a repository of paper, ink and glue. We&#8217;ll take a quick look at some of the cool stuff happening right now, and in the near future.</p>
<p>Dustin is the Overlord of Dorkbot Austin, was, until recently, the Webmaster for the University of Texas Libraries, and is one heck of a cat dad, according to his ward Audrey.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dorkbot is &#8211; As ALWAYS &#8211; a FREE and ALL AGES event.</p>

<p><strong>Mickey Delp</strong> &#8211; the chief inventor behind Delptronics talks to us about his interface design showcased at Fantastic Arcade. Delp&#8217;s customized surface for the arcade version of the video game Panoramical was the buzz of this year&#8217;s event. The Alamo Drafthouse described the experience as &#8220;creating instant compositions of audio and form, mountains rising and boiling away, clouds making way for stars and black rain.&#8221; <a href="http://delptronics.com/" target="_blank">http://delptronics.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Greg Cerveny</strong> Loves open source and DIY music technology.  So he&#8217;s here to share his sliders, buttons, and knobs that make it easy to prototype new musical experiences.
