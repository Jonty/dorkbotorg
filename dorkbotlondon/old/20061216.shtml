James Larsson, promising to show us a 'game controller for VERY sad men', while
<a href="http://electricstuff.co.uk">Mike 'Dr. Voltage' Harrison</a>, will be
inviting us to an interactive, participatory performance of the
'bluetooth-o-phone - bluetoothery at the edge of uselessness'. So, please come
prepared with phones, PDAs, frequency weapons, networked sex toys and other
devices that use that infernal technology. Amanda Windle (<a
href="http://amandawindle.com">www.amandawindle.com</a>) will share some of her
artbots research, and maybe give us some clues about her forthcoming year at an
AI Lab in Zurich. We don't know what Tim Hunkin is planning yet, but we expect it to be wonderful.

	Dancing into the night is facilitated by plenty of champagne and <a href="http://slub.org">Slub</a>.

library with a statue of Clement Atlee in front of it, then you'll see the Town
