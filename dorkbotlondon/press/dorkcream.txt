                 cream  * 12 *


********************************************************************

This dose of cream has a slightly unusual flavour. This is the first 'guest
edited' issue, and has grown out of a specific context and group of people from
dorkbotlondon, (www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotlondon), a monthly meeting of artists,
technologists, musicians and 'people doing strange things with electricity'. For
this reason, the texts are not all strictly 'critique' in themselves, but help
to construct a critical position by suggesting ways of working and thinking
about electronic art.

At dorkbotlondon last Wednesday, the final presentation was Ashraf Nehru's
'Frankie the Robot' an animated 3 dimensional DJ robot who seamlessly mixes up
to 4 mp3 tracks, synchronising even the most disparate rhythms, and wiggling his
hips provocatively as he spins his virtual vinyl. This is one future of music
performance: the endless re-mixing of existing tracks from every genre
imaginable, automatically synched into a beat-perfect, uniform rhythm by a
faceless performer/player. Frankie is already driven by a Playstation2
controller, and is coming soon as a commercial game. There are other futures,
cracks and seams in the veneer of digital music that have their own
particularities and aesthetics, some of which are presented here.

These three texts are reflections on music and musicianship, and how the
limits, techniques and potentials of those categories are influenced by digital
technologies. Alex Mclean, musician, programmer and artist (www.slab.org) picks
out some irritating norms of electronic music and then, as curative, introduces
us to the bash shell as musical performance tool. Jo Walsh (www.zooleika.org.uk)
imagines how semantic webs of meta-information  reconfigure our relationship to
music and music making. Michael Weinkove's (www.talkaoke.com) text is a critical
study of the changing icon of the musician, tracing the passage of the humble
technician to the superstar DJ we know today.

But this is not just about music. The performer, the virtuoso, the artiste, the
audience; these figures are changing. Perhaps in music, one of the most
economically active and universally significant areas of culture, one which has
embraced digital technologies most fervently, we can find clues as to how these
roles are developing in other areas of cultural production.

ANGRY   -       Alex Mclean


There are many examples of electronic artists surrounding their pieces with
dazzling effects while not actually letting you observe its central nature.


These are false boundaries.

Laptop musicians have plenty of movement happening inside their computer but
usually don't let us in on at any of it.  Movement adds so much to musical
performance but we can't see it because their software doesn't allow us to, or
they are too shy to let us see their screen.  Open up your music for us!  Your
computer can be so much more than a portable music studio.  If the music is
alive in there, let us see it.

Interfaces should not be so over-important as to hide the very experience they
are trying to interface us to.  Take http://www.altzero.net as an example.
Mapping one dimensional volume controls onto a two dimensional plane, and then
hiding them in a three dimensional rotating sphere adds little to music that is
by its nature multidimensional.  Piling in visual effects on top of all this is
playing the audience as a fool.

And finally, random events are no replacement for real interactivity. Random
numbers are perhaps the easiest source of data, but are by their nature
structureless and meaningless.  They should surely not be used as the core
structure behind an artwork.

These pieces of work annoy me because when I look for their promise, I either
find I am denied access or find nothing when I finally get there.  Open up your
processes!

/usr/bin/bash as a performative tool    -       Alex Mclean


I'm writing this to share some thoughts with those already initiated with the
bash shell. Those otherwise interested might like to read this
(http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html) first. If any parts of this article
are unclear or you have any questions, please email me (cream@slab.org) and I'll
clarify.

I've probably spent more time at a bash prompt than I have in any other place
apart from bed. It's my primary computer interface; it's part of most of my
daily tasks and rituals. I do use a GUI windowing environment, but still find
myself typing far more than clicking.

So what do I perform with bash? I make music with self-written Perl scripts,
that synchronise, play sounds and control synthesis parameters via a central
server. Some of these scripts are interactive and some aren't, and so a great
deal of the performance is controlled from the command line, starting sets of
scripts with particular parameters and then choosing the right moment to kill
them.

Typing long, textual commands seems like a slow and inexpressive way to make
live music. However I find this much faster than using a mouse, and more
expressive than using a guitar; but then, I'm a fast typist and am not much good
at playing the guitar. I also know a few handy bash shortcuts...

So lets cut to the meat. Here's how I use the bash prompt.


^n ^p ^b ^f ^a ^e

These are navigation control keys, in fact the first four are simple aliases
for the arrow keys; down, up, left and right respectively. These are keys I need
all the time but are located far away from the 'home keys'. You only save a
fraction of a second by hitting ^b rather than left-arrow, but in my opinion
shaving all these fractions is what turns you into a bash prompt maestro.


^r

Control and r is perhaps my most used performative expression. It lets you do a
reverse search through your entire command history. So if I want to find a
command I ran at a gig a couple of weeks or months ago, I can, with a few
key-presses. This is great, because I have no memory of my own.

There's a problem with this; you might accidentally re-run that dodgy 'rm -rf
.' command and delete all your files. You can pop the following HISTIGNORE
environment variable in your .bash_profile to stop this from happening, and
while you're there, why not drop in a HISTSIZE variable to keep your history for
longer:

HISTIGNORE="rm *"
HISTSIZE="2048"
export HISTIGNORE HISTSIZE


tab completion

Another shell shortcut under-used by many; tab completion! Most know that when
you type the first few characters of a command, file or directory name and then
press tab, the shell fills in the rest of the for you. But! It doesn't just
apply to filenames... Bash now has 'programmable completion', meaning that it
will now complete hostnames, process names, usernames, etc, etc... Download a
config file from here (http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion) and
weep with joy!


the last bit

Well, those are the most important bash keystrokes I use. When performing I
tend to end up with a lot of processes all over a mess of xterms, all with
various processes running in the background. So I end up using 'ps -wux' and
'kill' a lot to list and kill my processes. People seem to enjoy watching me
scrabble around, flicking through xterms running obtuse homemade curses
interfaces. Hopefully it's not too distracting everyone from the music itself...

Although it tends to come as default with Linux based systems, 'bash' is by no
means the only Unix shell. For example 'zsh' is well loved among its loyal fan
base. So have a look around, but whatever shell you opt for and whatever Unix
art you are creating, check out the man pages and you might find some wonderful
shortcuts to command prompt heaven.

Hypermusic      -       Jo Walsh


the data that data carries within it, connects to around it, hopeful or
heedless; metadata.

a chunk of data can speak for itself - 'i will be intelligible by the rules of
this format', 'so-and-so created this copy of me at such-and-such a date'. a
statement about the data can live somewhere else - 'the data at that location,
properly deployed, is a kind of jazz music', 'it relates strongly to this other
thing in my personal taste' - remembered, and offered or spidered into a
distributed network of agent stores.

or statements can emerge through a process of inference, extrapolating new
statements from the connections between existing ones - 'if X was in this band
at the time they made this tune, then X is probably playing in it' [better] or
the data that can be described by rules in the system - properties like 'bar
length' and 'bpm' with algorithms to discover them in chunks of musical data.

a commercial service offers to identify any recorded tune, no matter how
noisily played back, compared against its vast database of recordings. with
feedback and progressive reification, it will become easy to identify and
describe, for example, the structures most associated with certain states of
mind, or changes in atmosphere. to note and annotate the progression of a
musical progression, a certain (pattern)(regularity) of repetition working its
way through centuries and cultures. the identification of different synths,
software, fundamental sound sources becomes simpler with each propagating piece
of music.

the music data and metadata contained in the filesharer systems and on the web
is much greater and more deeply cross-referenced than the largest commercial
system. imagine; properties extrapolated from those properties, peoples'
opinions about all of them, indicating some archetypal tune or beat pattern.

the establishment of prior art amounts to copyrighting the musical genome. a
representation of the contrasting legal complexities of musicmaking and software
making. music can also be software, software can produce perennially different
music, like infinite drum and bass; each performance of the same named thing is
effortlessly variable. music is subject to transclusion, to filtering, at the
hands of the ultimate listener or through an intermediary.

between us all we make a kind of hypermusic, in a network modelled to reflect
more change.

The Future DJ Culture   -       Michael Weinkove.


'Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have
lightened the day's toil of any human being. They have enabled a greater
population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment, and an increased
number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes.' - The Principles of
Political Economy. John Stuart Mill

Dance Factory

We enter a building bigger than an aircraft hangar-like a recently erected,
warehouse or factory, yet to be let. An ocean of resin -coated concrete floors,
the only machines present are the sound system. But it's dark and deafeningly
noisy. There are 10 000 people there, all facing an illuminated figure on a
distant stage, the DJ, a man engrossed. In the era when factories have become
buzzing, silent, peopleless, computer controlled kingdoms, so the future DJ
festival becomes a reenactment of the classical factory experience. This system
is capable of generating over 120 decibels of sound. A tiny diamond the size of
a poppy seed vibrates as the concentric vinyl channel beneath rotates at a set
rate. The resulting tiny fluctuations in charge are amplified by a series of
transistors in the mixing console. The signal is passed through a series of
processors, split according to frequency as it is sent to several racks of power
amps and amplified again. Magnified many million tim!
es, the signals are converted back to sound by the loudspeakers.

Here in Barcelona, at the Sonar Festival of Electronic Music, it's possible to
enjoy the latest stage of development in the evolution of the dance movement.
Once upon a time the DJ appeared as the behind the scenes technician, a man who
tastefully, tirelessly and thanklessly selected hits that the people wanted to
dance to, occasionally introducing a new tune. He meekly facilitated enjoyment
at the party. With the emergence of hip hop, the DJ began to accompany the
rhymes instead of a backing band, and became an equal, if somewhat backstage
member of the band. Now the DJ has been promoted to the position of lead singer
and the musicians who created the music are no longer required to be present for
the live event. But the DJ's elevation has not stopped there. The superstar DJ
has graduated from the discreet DJ booth of contemporary nightclubs to the
upstage -illuminated with smoke, strobes and laser lights.


Selector, Mixer, Refiner


The DJ's job description is threefold.

"journey by DJ" - The DJ chooses the records to play in which order. It is
suggested that he selects tracks according to the mood of the crowd. This is the
most important part of the DJ's job a kind of dance music curator-a facilitator
for dance music to be heard in the right order.

"scratchmaster" - Interestingly DJ competitions which have arisen don't
concentrate on this aspect of the DJ's role but focus on the second part- the
DJ's ability to mix and blend individual records together into a continuous
seamless soundtrack and the DJ's own input of scratching; playing the record
rhythmically backwards and forwards, and sampling; taking a digital clippet from
a pre-existing track and overlaying it repetitively.

The third part is to get the sound right, adjusting the EQ levels (treble and
bass but more complicated) and other more sophisticated sound manipulation
exercises which give the DJs their "unique" sound.


"he uses a Pioneer FX500 for delay and echoes especially and two super filters
that completely kill the sound
... people notice. They always come up asking what the mix is and I tell them,
'It's the original mix, but I'm fucking with it and throwing an accapella over
it'" - Erick Morillo in DJ magazine, 2nd -15th June 01


The DJ's role is one part editorial, two parts technical. It's a job which
requires connoissieurship and technical skill but it's not especially
performative. To worship the DJ on the stage is to engender a cult that
celebrates technical ability on an equal level with creativity. The body
language of the DJ on stage is the body language of an expert getting on with
his job, like a diamond cutter.


Superstar DJ

Why must the superstar DJ must be on stage? Because he is a superstar. What we
see at this DJ festival in Barcelona is a visual terminology originating from
the rock star stadium gig: a tiny figure on a high stage in a massive sports
arena. One thinks of  Robbie Williams or U2, performers with an exuberant,
distinctly messianic character. Robbie Williams is the sex god, the audience
shamanised as a single body by the charisma of the performer, before he has even
opened his mouth. Abetted by hype, lights and sound reinforcement, he can whip
the crowd into a frenzy. By the way, Robbie Williams is just an ordinary bloke,
except he's Robbie Williams. This idea of the ordinary bloke/megastar
oscillation has been taken further by Williams than any other British performer.
He says himself he was just a man in the right place at the right time. he likes
girls, junk food and football. British pop stars don't have to be extreme
anymore. Their personas have none of the exuberance of Bo!
wie or Bolan or Lennon.

One of the developments of late nineties pop was that pop stars no  longer had
to prove their specialness. It is self evident from their position within the
structure. Earlier pop stars had to be extreme, weird and arty to justify their
status. The distancing/familiarization of the celebrity system is now enough to
establish them without distorting their personality (though perhaps
concentrating it). The Spice Girls gained popularity by being marketed as the
girl next door having a bit of fun. They are more genuine, everyday, down to
earth. The superstar DJ takes this celebration of the ordinary man even further.

But where does this leave the crowd? In a conventional dancehall or nightclub,
people dance in small huddles, facing each other. Here they face the
non-performing superstar DJ, no longer interacting with each other but facing a
single central node. The attraction of these large festivals or concerts has
always been as much about the gravity and craziness of so many people in one
place as about what they have come to see or do. A large crowd brings excitement
to itself in its very presence, a worry as much as a mass marketing opportunity.
The crowd has a unity, a power, a modus operandi that deviates from the normal
rules of social engagement. The rock star has a power to coalesce this mass of
individuals into a single motile force in the same way that one imagines that a
radical orator may have done in the nineteenth century. Even when nothing
happens, the sudden realisation within the mass of its potential gives an event
a buzz. There is a force inherent in so many young pe!
ople coming together. How does the future DJ manage to neutralise this force so
effectively?


Power means nothing without control

The DJ is a leader who is respected not for his passion or charisma but for
making the right choice at the right moment. We celebrate professionalism above
all. In this respect the DJ gives the people what they want. Through his
expertise he anticipates what the crowd wants. Yet he feels the vibe, rather
than explicitly consulting them. After all he is the man with the vision in
control of the crowd. The superstar DJ is a new kind of leader, who leads by
example into an ever more simplified cultural paradigm. It's like rock and roll
without the jazz or the funk or spunk what ever you want to call it.

One of the features of the evolution of the future DJ culture is the attitude
to requests. A friend of mine was a DJ twenty years ago. His "set" was made up
of requests-playing the hits of the time that people knew from the radio, or
things that were current in the dance halls and discos at the time. A friend of
a friend of mine is a DJ in London clubs today. He has a business card printed
especially to give to people who ask him for requests. It says, "Fuck off you
cunt". The recipient is generally so excited to receive a business card from the
DJ, so intoxicated, so disorientated by the ambience, that he puts it in his
pocket and walks off. This suggests a growing confidence. DJs have in their own
vision, in their ability to take control of the crowd and take it where they
think it should go. The crowd have faith in the DJ to be able to do this.


The tendency towards an evermore "efficient" entertainment.

'Deep, progressive grooves' - Flyer advertising a club night

Producers no longer bombard us with creativity but refine it and present as
little of it as possible within as bigger structure as possible. A diamond is
nothing without its display case. So the most is made of every gem that is
discovered. The gem is there too at the centre of the DJ's setup. The stripping
away of everything non-functional from a non-functional product reveals its
context only. Through streamlining to maximize profits, mass entertainment
products actually reveal the structure of the commercial world. Thus mass
culture has a kind of fractal structure; i.e. the patterns repeat at various
levels of analysis.

Take the example of the TV show Blind Date. It repeats endlessly the
essentially dilemma of the product. How can I choose from this limited range of
merchandise without first knowing about them? I cannot know about them without
having first made my commitment. The necessary typical  dissatisfaction at the
outcome of this choice becomes the entertainment. It is a dissatisfaction which
is echoed by the viewers who spent an hour watching the programme to find out
what would happen.

In the same way the DJ's music is stripped to the bare minimum. This is
undoubtedly the cheapest way to entertain 10 000 young people at a live event.
The prevailing mass product is always the cheapest thing you can sell to the
maximum number of people. A DJ is cheaper than a band. There is only one person
to pay rather than perhaps four. They need less technical support than a band,
no soundchecks or complicated and dangerous cabling. They are more predictable
than a band. The DJ gets on and does the job. He plays the music. There will be
no encore, no prima donna strops, no last minute nerves, no laryngitis. Formerly
people would only come in thousands to see bands. With the advent of the
superstar DJ, a man playing other people's recordings can bring in just as many.
The two turntables and a mixer connected to a PA system is the universal setup
that you can find in virtually any country worldwide. It is the lingua franca of
live entertainment.

I stand, moved by this global event. I don't see people having a good time, I
see the future here, it is a future of global sameness. Gradually everything
that makes us different will be dissolved, because it is everything that is
different that makes us fight.
