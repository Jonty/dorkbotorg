<b>FUELAIR</b><br>
presenting at <a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotlondon/">dorkbotlondon</a>, wednesday sept 11th 2002
<p>
In the first FUELAIR field tests we begin to develop a
low-tech audio recording tool designed to capture the
impact and ignition of a petrol bomb from within. The
tests probe the capabilities of the tool, aiming to
optimise sound fidelity at the critical moment of
ignition.
</p><p>
Using slow motion and real time digital video and
audio captured by the device to document the trials,
the focus is upon the strange and unexpected sound
transmitted from within the Molotov Cocktails. We feel
that the emphasis on sound offers an alternative
discourse which can break through the media spectacle
to produce a fresh subjectivity.
</p><p>
By investigating the materiality of the Molotov
Cocktail we hope to comprehend the kind of Fuel-Air
weapons used by US forces in Bosnia and Afghanistan.
The resulting work questions the state-sanctioned
status of the large-scale weapon of the geopolitical
battlefield over the homemade tool of the
disenfranchised individual.
