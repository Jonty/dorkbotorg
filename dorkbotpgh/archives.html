<p><strong>Mark Barlow</strong>: Mark  has designed and/or installed over a megawatt of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. His contributions to solar PV installations can be seen aside the hills of the Ohio River valley, atop a city skyscraper of downtown Pittsburgh, and among the distant lands of Nicaragua and Greece. He currently volunteers his time to the local Pittsburgh Engineers Without Borders (EWB) chapter, assisting with water and energy projects located in Ecuador and India.</p>
<p>A long time student of Nikola Tesla's work and writings, Mark is especially interested in Tesla's ideas regarding energy production and transmission. A Tesla enthusiast, Mark built his first Tesla coil while in high school and has constructed half a dozen coils over the years. These coils vary in shape and construction with their output voltages ranging from a few kilovolts to megavolts.</p>

His research interests primarily focus on novel interaction technologies and input methods - especially those that leverage sensing and the environment in unconventional and expressive ways. In his free time, Chris gets excited about large data sets and how, through computation, they can be given form. Often, this is through the use of simple visual primitives that self assemble into rich information tapestries.</p>

Susanne has exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, her paintings have also been recognized through an artist fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and four awards from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. Susanne was honored as 2008 “Artist of the Year” by the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts where she premiered “R&amp;R(&amp;R),” an ongoing series of works on paper that convert our military expression for “rest and recuperation” to images of “revelation, regret, and restoration.”  These and new works will be featured in a January, 2010 solo exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center. </p>

												<p><strong>Keny Marshall.</strong> Keny builds kinetic, sometimes robotic art that plays with technology and how people relate to it. Hand-built devices are combined in seemingly ridiculous ways as a means of critiquing the increasingly invisible world that technology inhabits. Electric motors, surplus lab equipment, and scrap hardware are (re)sourced to build systems with transparent inner workings to counteract the “blackbox” nature of present technology. 
Currently Keny is the Coordinator of Special Projects for Phil Fraley Productions, where he manages teams of artists, blacksmiths, and fossil preparators in the fabrication, installation and rigging of large scale natural history museum exhibits. </p>

												<p>We have two speakers this month, Michael Philetus Weller and Elizabeth Monian.</p>
												<p><strong>Elizabeth Monoian</strong></p>
												<p>Elizabeth Monoian will speak on the topic of &quot;Committing to Pittsburgh as Interdisciplinary Art Practice&quot;. Elizabeth Monoian is an interdisciplinary artist who uses the Internet, found objects and spaces, electronic noise, video, and performance to tease apart and question cultural relationships to time, history, and memory.</p>
												<p>Performatively she becomes Eliza. Willing to live the nightmare of grade-school child standing in front of the classroom naked, she is exposed to the familiar gaze of strangers. Elizabeth becomes the image -- the performance, the character -- that is viewed. Eliza navigates within the noise of contemporary culture -- the cacophony of electronics and wires that bring whales above the ocean surface to sing and nurtures premature infants in the neonatal ward -- the chatter of capitalism that permeates our cellular selves.</p>
												<p>Elizabeth founded and co-directs Society for Cultural Exchange with her twin sister Barbara. Society for Cultural Exchange is a unique non-profit arts organization that is developing exchanges nationally and internationally in three distinctive locations. They have an artist in residency program and art space located in a 2500 sq. foot Victorian house in an historical steel neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA, an artist in residency program on a fishing boat in the Native American Tlingit Village of Hoonah, Alaska, as well as an art space in their rent-stabilized apartment in the East Village, New York City. Currently they are transforming a blighted lot in Pittsburgh into an outdoor/public electronic media center.</p>

												<p></p>
												<p><strong>Michael Philetus Weller</strong></p>
												<p>Michael Philetus Weller will demonstrate Posey, a computationally enhanced poseable hub and strut construction kit that can be used as an interface to applications running on a host computer. Its optocoupled ball and socket joints transmit local topology information and determine the roll, pitch and yaw of connections. Zigbee transceivers in each hub communicate this data wirelessly back to the host computer. The host computer assembles a representation of the physical model as the user creates and configures it. This representation can then be used by application programs to control models in particular domains. For example, a skeleton of a puppet can be used to control the movement of a more detailed virtual puppet to create an online puppet show. And by connecting posey to a molecule modeling application, information on different molecules can be retrieved just by building the molecule using hubs as atoms and struts as bonds.</p>
												<p>Michael Philetus Weller is a Ph.D. Candidate in the CoDe Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. He is experimenting with ways computation can be embedded in buildings and furniture to reimagine our relationship with the built environment. He holds a B.A. in Philosophy, a B.A. in Architecture and a Master of Architecture from the University of Washington. He believes in Open Source, and believes everyone should read Daniel Dennett.</p>

												<p>Carl DiSalvo and Tom Lauwers, CREATE Lab</p>
												<p>CREATE -- Community Robotics for Education, Art, &amp; Technology Empowerment -- Lab is committed to broadening public participation in science, technology, engineering through the development of disruptive robotic technologies.</p>
												<p>Tom and Carl will present a survey of recent projects undertaken by the CREATE Lab, including TeRK, Robot Diaries, Neighborhood Nets, and Robot 250. These projects range from hardware and software technology development, educational robotics for middle school girls, arts based community robotics, to the development of a large scale city wide robotic art and technology event involving thousands of participants.<br>
												</p>
												<p>Tom Lauwers is a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute. He has a long-standing interest in educational robotics, as both a participant in programs like FIRST and later as a designer of a robotics course and related education technology. He is currently studying curriculum design and evaluation and hopes that his study of the educational sciences will help him create educational technologies that are relevant and responsive to the needs of educators. Tom received a BS in Electrical Engineering and Public Policy from CMU in 2003.</p>
												<p>Carl DiSalvo received a PhD in Design the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. Carl's work approaches design from a critical and reflective perspective. He uses design to ask questions, provoke debate and facilitate conversations concerning the social aspects of technologies and technological discourses. Carl is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow in The Studio for Creative Inquiry and the Center for the Arts in Society. Carl also is a founder of the Pittsburgh GIS company <a href="http://www.deeplocal.com/">DeepLocal</a>.</p>

												<p>Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist. His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior, and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.</p>
