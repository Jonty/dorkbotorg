    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p><em>Dorkbot</em> is a meeting of people interested in
      electric/electronic art in the broadest sense; robotics, kinetic
      art, microcontrollers, interactive art, algorithmic music,
      net.art...  The only real conditions are that it is a bit
      strange and involves electricity in some way.  It is really
      defined by whoever turns up, be it engineers who want to be
      artists, or artists who want to be engineers, or the otherwise
      confused.
    </p>
    
    <p>Dorkbot started in <a href="/dorkbotnyc/">New York</a>, spread
      to <a href="/dorkbotlondon/">London</a>, and now <a href="/">dozens
        of cities around the world</a> including several active UK
      chapters; <a href="/dorkbotbristol/">Bristol</a>, <a href="/dorkbotanglia/">Anglia</a>, <a href="/dorkbotnewcastle/">Newcastle</a>, <a href="/dorkbotcardiff/">Cardiff</a>
      and <a href="/dorkbotalba/">Alba</a> (Scotland).</p>

    <p>There's a lot of great dorky activities already happening in
      Sheffield
      around <a href="http://thegisthub.net/">GIST</a>, <a href="http://access-space.lowtech.org/">access
      space</a>, <a href="http://www.lovebytes.org.uk/">lovebytes</a>, <a href="http://www.interestingnorth.com/">interesting
      north</a>, <a href="http://shacknet.thegisthub.net/">shacknet</a>
      and elsewhere.  For this reason dorkbotsheffield is just an
      occasional event.
