PHYSICAL COMPUTING AND YOU:<br />
AN INTRODUCTION TO ARDUINO</span></span><br />
Dorkbot Adelaide presents an introductory workshop to physical computing, which is the field of controlling and responding to the real world using computers. This exciting area allows anyone to easily add interactivity and complexity to a variety of digital projects.</p>
<p>In this hands-on, practical workshop, participants will learn about the basics of using the Arduino platform. Topics covered include an introduction to Arduino programming; digital and analog inputs and outputs; how to connect a variety of components to Arduino; and how to integrate the hardware into popular software packages.</p>
<p>The workshop will be held on Sunday, 28th June from 11am onwards at the Electronic Music Unit, University of Adelaide. The cost is $15 per person. No prior knowledge is required.</p>
<p>As numbers are strictly limited, <span style="font-weight: bold;">bookings are essential</span>. To book, simply email <span>seb.tomczak@gmail.com</span> or phone Seb on 0430 213 700.</p>

degree was highly collaborative and allowed him to work with directing,<br />
producing and cinematography students. Whilst at AFTRS, Daniel developed a motion control solution that allowed camera information to seamlessly travel from *Maya to onset.* Prior to Film School, Daniel was a<br />
freelance TV editor, as well as working on numerous short films.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each dorkbot is different and is driven by the needs and interests of people in the local community. But generally, the main goals of dorkbot are: to create an informal, friendly environment in which people can talk about the work they&#8217;re doing and to foster discussion about that work; to help bring together people from different backgrounds who are interested in similar things; to give us all an opportunity to see the strange things our neighbors are doing with electricity. dorkbot isn&#8217;t really a forum for formal artist talks or lectures, but rather a chance for diverse people to have friendly conversations about interesting ideas.</p>
