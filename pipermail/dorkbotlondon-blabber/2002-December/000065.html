Katrina McPherson &amp; Simon Fildes - Hyperchoreography

slateford : greylines 00-06

- we are making old-time code - we live in a grey world - we hope for the
future but enjoy today - sometimes we do not know why we do what we do -
it works for us - we hope it works for you -
- slateford

Greylines was produced through a series of &quot;code doodles&quot; which 
slateford exchanged via email. The series is partly inspired by their 
joint admiration for the early twentieth-century experimental 
animators Hans Richter and Oskar Fischinger.

Katrina McPherson &amp; Simon Fildes - Hyperchoreography

Hyperchoreography is a non-linear dance performance 'space' existing 
in an interactive and networked medium. The artists' collaborative 
work in video-dance has made them aware that the 'final edit' 
provides just one from a range of infinite possibilities. The 
material that is discarded is often just as interesting as the final 
work. Hyperchoreography was born from a desire to expose more of that 
process to an audience. The dance can be sequentially altered by user 
interaction, navigating through looped moving images.

---------

Slateford are Simon Yuill (Scotland) and Tryggve Askildsen (Norway). 
Slateford is a collaborative project through which they are exploring 
the dual aesthetics of outdated computer systems and the brittle 
sensuality of Northern European (Atlantic + Baltic) cultures.

Slateford are supported by the lipparosa code repository

Katrina McPherson has built a strong reputation for working with 
video and contemporary dance. She recently received a Creative 
Scotland Award to develop new work. Katrina has produced several 
award-winning works, and completed numerous broadcast commissions, 
including a recent Arts Council of England 'Capture' award. Simon 
Fildes is an artist working with new media. In 2001 he completed a 
'Year of the Artist' residency at Concrete Butterfly, a designer 
furniture shop in Edinburgh. An earlier interactive project, 'Weaving 
Traffic' a collaboration with Stephen Hunter, was exhibited in Kyoto, 
Japan.

Katrina and Simon recently collaborated with New Media Scotland on 
REMOTE, new media artists' residencies and an exhibition in the 
Scottish Highlands.

Hyperchoreography is supported by Alt-W and New Media Scotland
