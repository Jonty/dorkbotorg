=============================== 


c) net-art02/03? open_digi

as some of you may have noticed there has been no 2002 edition of the 'net-art' 
open arena at www.net-art.ws organised or announced.  As you can see from the 
list of &gt;wartime&lt; project events and hapenings at top of this mail, for the duration 
this is taking up the majority of available time of people previously involved in 
running the annual 'net-art' event. So I am afraid this edition of 'net-art' will not 
happen. Hopefully things will be more peaceful by the appropriate time for a net-
art03.

Similarly with so many shows and events of &gt;wartime&lt; planned or in planning 
around the world, its really not possible to continue the monthly local open_digi 
events in Brixton, South London for the time being.

thanks for your support

yours sincerely
atty
