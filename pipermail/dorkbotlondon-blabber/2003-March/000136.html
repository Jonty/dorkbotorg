</I>THE BRUNSWICK PROJECT: Visions of Space &amp; Sanctuary

An intriguing site-specific exhibition in one of London's 
most recogniseable and iconic buildings from the 1960's.

The Brunswick Centre, Bloomsbury, London WC1
Dates: 4 - 6 April 2003
Times: Fri/Sat 12-8  Sun 12 - 6
Tube: Russell Square or King's Cross
Bus:  59, 7, 68, 168, 91

The Brunswick Centre, located between King's Cross and Russell Square is
a Grade II listed building conceived by the architect Patrick
Hodgkinson. It provides low-rise high-density housing, shops, offices, a
cinema and car parking within an extraordinaryconcrete and glass
mega-structure.

As part of ongoing works to bring the building back to life, and marking
over 30 years of social and cultural cohabitation in this 'city within a
city', the Tenants and Residents Association  teamed up with two local
artist/curators, and the building's original architect, to select 19
artists projects for this unique event. The selected artists,
representing a diversity of backgrounds, explore the theme 'Visions of
Space and Sanctuary' using projection, sound, performance and sculptural
installation to engage with the architecture and everyday life of The
Brunswick Centre.

The Artists
Arkem, Bill Aitchinson, Camilla Brueton, Sarah Carne, Sophie Chery, Zak
Crafer, Disinformation, Eveleigh &amp; Evans, Sarah Girard, Rachel Gomme,
Jana Haldrich &amp; David Davies, Rory Hamilton, Alice Lunt, McCormack &amp;
Gent, Gary O' Connor, Catherine Packard, Lucille Power, Theo Tagholme,
Duncan Whitley.

Bill Aitchinson is a recipient of of a liveartmagazine/New Works
Bursary.
Catherine Packard and Lucille Power are recipients of Artsadmin Artists'
Bursaries

Featured work includes
Bill Aitchison
'If you lived here you'd be home by now'
Bill has written a game book specifically for the Brunswick Centre. The
booklet offers many possible routes. Each player will trace a unique
path, partly orchestrated by the author and partly left to chance. The
process is more important than the goal in this treasure hunt where
imagination transforms the insignificant into a wealth of meanings.

Sarah Carne
'Neighbours'
Having previously made a film of the 1952 Western 'High Noon', shot
without dramatic action and using the workers of a northern industrial
estate, this new work domesticates Sarah Carne's approach by asking the
residents of the Brunswick Centre to read the script of an episode of
Neighbours. The residents are both brought together and seen in their
isolation. This tension upsets conventional distinctions between reality
and fiction and questions the stereotyped portrayal of communities.

Zak Crafer 
'The plastically modified future fantasy garden' is a pre-formed
environment that can be unpacked and installed in vacant spaces. It
offers a glimpse into a world of rural tranquillity in the middle of
urban commotion.

Sarah Girard
'No dogs allowed'
The terraces above the Brunswick Centre's shopping street were meant to
be places to play, congregate, and relax. At some point in the recent
past they lost their purpose, or rather it was taken. Now there are only
signs, 'No ball games, no cycling, no dogs'. Sarah Girard gives back to
these spaces some of their frivolity, by sitting her Dalmatians on them.
These quirky creatures, noses in the concrete, bottoms raised to all
above, are arranged in a regimented fashion like the flats around them.

Rachel Gomme
'Artery' 
A thin line of grass winds through the empty terraces, joining its
isolated trees. A softly subversive growth amid the grey concrete, a
green artery carrying a flow of breath, energy and life through the
centre, reinforcing the connection between living beings.

Lucille Power
'Inter-action'
Inter-action looks at how we build a sense of self within the urban
spaces of the inner city. Exploring our relationship with the in-between
spaces we share daily with our neighbours, it asks what these spaces
mean to us. Watched by a video camera, a woman moves upon sand within
the spaces that make up the buildings' shared areas. The trace of her
presence is found in the disturbed sand upon the floor. 

Duncan Whitley
Untitled
The semi-enclosed, cathedral-like spaces that provide access to the
flats in The Brunswick Centre are filled with the noise of pigeons
taking off and in flight. Moving to and fro, the sound of fluttering
wings draws the eye of the audience around the space, encouraging fresh
contemplation of the site.
