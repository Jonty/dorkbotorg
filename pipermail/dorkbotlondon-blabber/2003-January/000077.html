Software Art Repository

is now open for upload / download

****************************************

About:

Runme.org is a software art repository. It is an open, moderated
database to which people are welcome to submit projects they consider to
be interesting examples of software art.

Software art is an intersection of two almost non-overlapping realms:
software and art. It has a different meaning and aura in each. Software
art gets its lifeblood and its techniques from living software culture
and represents approaches and strategies similar to those used in the
art world.

Software culture lives on the Internet and is often presented through
special sites called software repositories. Art is traditionally
presented in festivals and exhibitions.

The aim of Runme.org is to create an exchange interface for artists and
programmers which will work towards a contextualization of this new form
of cultural activity. Runme.org welcomes projects regardless of the date
and context of their creation. The repository is happy to host different
kinds of projects - ranging from found, anonymous software art to famous
projects by established artists and programmers.

Runme.org and Read_me:

In winter/spring 2003 Runme.org will serve as the submission form and
database for the second edition of the Read_me festival. Read_me 2.3
(<A HREF="http://m-cult.org/read_me">http://m-cult.org/read_me</A>) will be held in May 30-31, 2003 in Helsinki,
presenting best software art projects submitted to Runme.org up until
the festival deadline, 1 of March.  However, after this date Runme.org
will continue to function as a software art repository.

Welcome!


****************************************
Runme.org is supported by NIFCA, The Nordic Institute for Contemporary
Arts, Lume, and m-cult.
