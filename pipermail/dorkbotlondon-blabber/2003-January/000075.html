File Sound Art, aka artists Philip Duckworth and Ben Sadler, is a Midlands based art project that has been in operation since 2000. 

The work presented through File is wide ranging in production, location and content. Spoken word, field recordings, computer generated sound, performance documentation, disco and karaoke have all been taken under the File wing to be lovingly sent out into the world.

File 05 is a Mead gallery special edition that reflects on facets of urban experience. Pirate radio stations, lonely hearts columns and molotov cocktails are landmarks on an aural highway navigating love, music, protest and the daily grind. The selection was inspired by the Phoenix project, a series of major architectural and visual arts commissions that seek to regenerate the post-war city centre of Coventry. 

File is available from Mead Gallery, Coventry, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, Whitechapel Gallery, London, ICA, London and www.palm90.com
