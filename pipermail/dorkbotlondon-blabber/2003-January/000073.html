<PRE>hi dorkbot people

as the American administration, in the space of 24 hours, 
committs a further 62,000 military to an attack on Iraq, the 
online edition of the &gt;wartime&lt; project is now open at 
<A HREF="http://offline.area3.net/wartime">http://offline.area3.net/wartime</A>

in the &gt;wartime&lt; project over fifty digital and network artists, 
individuals or groups across this planet, organizing through 
the internet, have contributed pieces reflecting on and 
reacting against wars, past, present and future. A further fifty 
or so artists are currently registered to contribute to the 
project in the future.

the project is also designed to be capable of being shown 
LIVE in public and a calendar of these events is on the site.

we hope that the reach and diversity of approach, materials, 
sentiments and location in the component parts of our project 
demonstrates that we will not be dragged into war without 
reaction, without questioning, and that we have the will and 
capacity to defy the borders and barriers erected between 
people by war makers.

current UK and US forces already surrounding or heading for 
Iraq now number over 160,000. Probably the concentration in 
quantity and expense of the weaponry and its destructive 
potential which has been assembled facing Iraq has never 
been matched before. Heavy casualties for civilian and military 
are very possible if the cities of Iraq are to be entered and 
attacked. This and the possibility of war wider in the Middle 
East and further can threaten our environment and lives 
nearly everywhere on this planet. 

If we are responsible to ourselves and to others we should 
consider making what contribution we can to halting this 
descent into destruction, working in our own areas and with 
our own particular skills, as we are attempting to do with the 
&gt;<i>wartime&lt; project, and with initiatives such as 
</I><A HREF="http://artcontext.org/antiWar/index.php,">http://artcontext.org/antiWar/index.php,</A> and by joining wider 
activities such as the US wide anti-war day on January 18th 
and the planned anti-war marchs across Europe on Febuary 
15th.
