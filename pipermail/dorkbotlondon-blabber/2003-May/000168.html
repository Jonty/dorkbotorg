<PRE>Dear Dorkbots,

As promised, the all singing, all dancing Cartographic Congress kicks off in
Kennington Park this Sunday.

See you all there, and at the June cartography-flavoured dorkbotlondon (more
on that soon),

X

Saul.

----------------------------------

Dear Cartographers,

The Cartographic Congress, a meeting of maps and mapmakers from all corners
of cartography begins its schedule of events this Sunday.

Starting on Sunday 11th with a field trip to Kennington Park, Collaborative
Mapping week launches with a Monday night Unix warm-up, then the
Collaborative Cartography show 'n tell on Tuesday 13th and the first
London-based game of noderunner on Thursday 15th May. Then, to round it all
off, a pirate party on Hijacker Island (Limehouse).

The map room and the hall of maps were inaugurated this Monday with the
installation of maps and cartographic materials
(maps/books/leaflets/texts/computers) which will be open regularly (but do
email/phone to make sure before dropping in). Please do bring more materials
of all kinds - there's plenty of pinboard space left, and its never too late
to come by with a project.

The Map Room
<A HREF="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/TheMapRoom">http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/TheMapRoom</A>

Please find full scheduling information for the next week below. See you at
the Congress!

cheers,

 the Cc

WEEK 2 THEME: Mapping Contemporary Capitalism
<A HREF="http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC">http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC</A>

Mapping Contemporary Capitalism (McC) is a long term software
development project with the goal of creating a tool for mapping
relations of power. The software is based on newly emerging
opensource protocols for data management and visualisation and
borrows much of its knowledge (The Semantic Web) from Internet
pioneers such as Tim Berners-Lee and cartographers such as Bureau
d'Etudes.

As part of the CartographicCongress we are planning to run a research
week dedicated to the project 'Mapping Contemporary Capitalism' from
the 19 May until the 23 May. The plan is to bring together people who
have a long term interest in working on the project so as to work on
a preliminary research framework. At the end of the week we would
look to have agreed on working practice, research areas and
prototyping strategies (all of this we would look to have distilled
into a report by the end of the week).

Technologies:
McC will be based on the following open protocols:

* RDF - Resource Description Framework
* RSS - Rich Site Summary
* FOAF - Friend Of A Friend
* OWL - Web Ontology Language
* SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics


----------------- Monday 19th - Tuesday 20th May ---------
RESEARCH WORKSHOP: re-cap of the previous weeks workshops on
collaborative mapping and learning about the semantic web.
<A HREF="http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC#RESEARCH_Recap_on_Sematic_web">http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC#RESEARCH_Recap_on_Sematic_web</A>

----------------- Tuesday 21st - Friday 23rd May ---------
RESEARCH WORKSHOP: daily research working groups 10am  - 6pm
<A HREF="http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC#RESEARCH_McC_general">http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC#RESEARCH_McC_general</A>

------------------------- Friday 23rd May ---------------
DINNER: 8pm dinner (menu to be confirmed)
<A HREF="http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC#DINNER_McC_dinner">http://docs.metamute.org/view/Home/McC#DINNER_McC_dinner</A>

Getting involved:
McC involves many slippery entities; cartographers, technologists,
artists, writers, theorists to mention few and more. If you would
like to take in the project please email the UO list
<A HREF="mailto:uo@twenteenthcentury.com">uo@twenteenthcentury.com</A> , the workshops will be open to people
informally dropping by.


------------------------- Saturday 24th May ---------------
FIELD TRIP: Orford-Ness &amp; Suffolk Coast

*A meeting place and time have not yet been arranged for further
information see the following link
<A HREF="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/CcFieldTripToOrfordNess">http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/CcFieldTripToOrfordNess</A>

&quot;The largest vegetated shingle spit in Europe, Orford Ness is
recognised as having great nature conservation importance. However,
it has spent much of the 20th century shrouded in mystery as a Top
Secret military test site. From birds to bombs, marshes to missiles
there is nowhere quite like this unique part of the Suffolk coast.&quot;

*The official line from <A HREF="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/orfordness/">http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/orfordness/</A>

But many other sites - Bentwaters Parks and Woodbridge USAF/RAF
bases, separated by Rendlesham forest (ufo country) and nearby
Bawdsey Manor will make interesting visits too.

Schedule:
Saturday 24th May - time, meeting point, route and transport mode TBC

Getting involved:
Please email the UO list <A HREF="mailto:uo@twenteenthcentury.com">uo@twenteenthcentury.com</A> if you'd like to
come on this Cc field trip.
