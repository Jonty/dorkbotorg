Drift: Sound Art + Experimental Music
Call For Participation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Media Scotland calls for participation for Drift - an exploration 
of sound art and experimental music which comprises live events, 
radio broadcasts, moving image and publications.

The accessibility of the Internet together with new tools and methods 
for digital recording, manipulation, reproduction and distribution 
have changed forever the way that we think about and interact with 
sound, giving us new ways to communicate our ideas. An increasing 
number of artists, producers, DJ's and sonic creators, from a broad 
spectrum of disciplines and varying modes of practice, are exploring 
streaming media as a viable format. We want to open up this channel 
further.

We are offering four opportunities to take part in Drift, details 
follow. Further information, guidelines and application forms 
available from the Drift web site:

Resonant Cities: Call for Sound Works
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Media Scotland seeks sound works for 'Resonant Cities': Internet 
radio streaming that explore the sonic identity of our surrounding 
space and that engage with the fragmented 'noise' of the city 
soundscape: people, traffic, communication intrusions, mobile phones, 
radio traffic, city wildlife, buildings...

We are particularly interested in audio works which involve one or 
several of the following ideas or processes:

- Acoustic Ecology - Acousmatics - Phonography - Sonic research - 
Radio art, Internet radio - Microsound - Lowercase sound - Internet 
communication media and audio streaming - Electronic communities - 
Artists' software for sound and music - Sound work developed using 
open source processes and principles - Generative sound - Sound 
archives - Spoken word / oral history - Field recordings - The 
re-purposing / representing of existing analogue sound recordings, 
such as amateur recordings, scientific recordings, and accidental, 
lost or abandoned recordings -

The works selected by the Drift team will then be curated into themed 
streams that will be available via this web site.

Our intention is to expand the audience for the work, encourage 
appreciation of sound art, and broaden access to a genre which is too 
often labelled as esoteric and inaccessible.

We cannot pay a fee for this opportunity, but we will facilitate the 
broadcast of your work.

Eligibility - Open to artists, musicians, producers in the UK and 
across the globe.

Guidelines and submission form available from <A HREF="http://www.mediascot.org/drift">http://www.mediascot.org/drift</A>

Drift Touring Video Programme: Call for Moving Image Works
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Media Scotland seeks sound-based moving image works for Drift. We 
plan to curate and tour a feature-length programme of short moving 
image works. We are looking for films and videos which take as their 
starting point sound art or experimental music. This can include 
experimental moving image works by artists and films made by 
musicians, as well as pieces which combine performance aesthetics 
with sound.

The Drift moving image programme will tour to venues in Scotland, the 
UK and internationally. A specially designed brochure will be 
produced featuring information on the artists and their works.

Fee - Selected artists will be paid a fee for the rights to tour the work.

Eligibility - Open to artists, musicians, producers based in Scotland 
and the UK.

Guidelines and submission form available from <A HREF="http://www.mediascot.org/drift">http://www.mediascot.org/drift</A>

Drift organised by New Media Scotland. Supported by the Scottish Arts 
Council, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and
