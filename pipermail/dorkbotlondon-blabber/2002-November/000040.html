Richard Stallman  
founder of the gnu project

2nd &amp; 3rd December 2002

COPYRIGHT VS COMMUNITY
Copyright developed in the age of the printing press, and was 
designed to fit with the system of centralized copying imposed 
by the printing press. But the copyright system does not fit 
well with computer networks, and only draconian punishments can 
enforce it.

The global corporations that profit from copyright are lobbying 
for draconian punishments, and to increase their copyright 
powers, while suppressing public access to technology. But if we 
seriously hope to serve the only legitimate purpose of copyright 
- to promote progress for the benefit of the public - then we 
must make changes in the other direction.

Tuesday 3rd December 2002, 18:30-20:30
Hong Kong Theatre (D1)

AGAINST SOFTWARE PATENTS
Richard Stallman will explain how software patents obstruct 
software development. Software patents are patents that cover 
software ideas. They restrict the development of software, so 
that every design decision brings a risk of being sued. Patents 
in other fields restrict factories, but software patents 
restrict every computer used. Economic research shows that they 
even retard progress.

Attendance is free. 
To register for one or both of the seminars please contact:
Ms Emma Peel, Research Co-ordinator
