<PRE>This may be of interest to some DorkBotters, hope to see some of you there

Well, what do you know...it pays to be a Recordist!

S.Higgins and I both received art grants from the Canada Council earlier
this year for Recordist/Surrealist-related work in performance art (go
figure!).

So guess what...we're taking a trip!

We'll be visiting surrealist friends and other fascinating folk in the U.K.
and in Paris between June 26 and July 14.

In addition to the various meetings we've arranged (details of which I'll be
sure to pass along at a later date), we've also arranged to do some
performances in London (mostly improvised music gigs for myself and our
friend from the Stockholm Surrealist Group Johannes Bergmark). Here's a

group Six Heads will perform and record live (hand-built instruments, toys
and objects, prerecorded material, etc.) and discuss their process, other
projects, etc., while back in Toronto, the other half of Six Heads will
record the usual monthly jam session. The recordings made by both halves of
the group will be further collaged together at a later date. Joining James,
Sherri, and William in the studio will be Robert Atwood, former member of
Urban Refuse Group. (note: the date for this performance may be bumped to
