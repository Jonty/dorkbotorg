Artist's Talk (John Paul Bichard) : Sunday 22 June 2003, 3pm

VM.01 is a Variablemedia event marking a year of on-line artists'
residencies. It will both present and elaborate on all 6 of the first
years on-line projects. The www.variablemedia.org site has hosted
artists based in England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. Some
regularly make work for the Internet, for others their Variablemedia
project was their first on-line work.

Variablemedia's website projects will be presented on computers in the
gallery space alongside new and related works by all of the involved
artists, most made specifically for this exhibition. These works
encompass a wide spectrum of media including drawings, digital prints,
video and audio. Some artworks will be available in multiples, for
visitors to take away for free.

After VM.01 remaining archived projects will be removed from the
Variablemedia server, leaving only the descriptions of the works and
links, where such exists, to their new location. VM.01 represents a last
chance to see some of the works produced in Variablemedia's first year
of residencies.
