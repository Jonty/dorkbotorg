REMOTE
new media artists respond to the Scottish Highlands
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Iona Gallery, Kingussie, Inverness-shire
Exhibition: 4-16 November 2002
Open Mon-Fri 1-5pm Sat 10am-12pm. Admission free

What happens when urban realism and rural romanticism collide?

An exhibition featuring seven artists invited to respond to the 
physical and social environments in the Cairngorms through 
residencies in the area during Summer 2002.

Thomson &amp; Craighead will exhibit new work 'The Price of Freedom' - a 
modified book form appropriating lines from John Barbour's epic poem, 
'The Bruce', as domain names offered for sale; and 'Making a case for 
the twinning of Newtonmore and Las Vegas', an open public letter 
accessible online.

r a d i o q u a l i a's 'listening_stations' project resulted from a 
residency at makrolab - a temporary art and science laboratory 
located near Blair Atholl during the summer of 2002. The work is part 
of ongoing research to make audible via an online radio station 
astronomy signals intercepted from space, including the planet 
Jupiter and the Sun.

Simon Fildes and Katrina McPherson, both based in Newtonmore, are 
showing a number of projects including an interactive sound 
sculpture, web-journeys and found objects inspired by the A889 road 
from Dalwhinnie to Laggan, dubbed 'the most dangerous road in 
Britain'.

Cavan Convery, presents 'Ground Truth' - an on-line Geographical 
Information System of data, collected by a remote roving platform 
that records images and sound, overlaid on an extraordinary 3-D 
contour map of the Cairngorms offering sentimental personal 
discoveries.

Following the exhibition, the works can be experienced as part of 
HOST, New Media Scotland's online project space at 
<A HREF="http://host.mediascot.org">http://host.mediascot.org</A>

Artists' Talk: 3-5pm, Saturday 16 November 2002.
Refreshments provided. Admission free.
Chair: Dr Anna Paterson, writer and journalist, University of St 
Andrews. Author of 'Scotland's Landscape: Endangered Icon' (Polygon, 
2002).
