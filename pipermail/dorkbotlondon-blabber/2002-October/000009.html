<PRE>Alex:
An old acquaintance of mine has made a film about artists, which may be of
interest to dorkbot and/or State51 people , see his web site
www.diyordie.org 


In an email chat, he suggested:

'set up a cheap paid showing, i'll give you a percent and send you a DVD
to show it from. the DVD is all regions and will work there.'

Since it is not specifically about electricity, it is not within Dorkbot ,
though several people may be interested. Have you any interest in this?

I am really bad at locating venues and equipment for such things, also I
probably don't particularly need the &quot;percent&quot; either, at least not if it
involves spending time on postering or whatever,  but I would like to see
the film and help Michael gain exposure for his work ... just a thought ...


-Robert
