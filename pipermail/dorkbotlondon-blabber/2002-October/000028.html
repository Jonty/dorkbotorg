-- By god son, in my day the culprits would have been put over a fence and
horsewhipped, and what about the ladies, I ask you, if a man can't dorkbot
in safety things have come to a pretty pass, I blame that Tony Blair myself,
look what he has done to fox hunting, by god, call the army out, give them a
good thrashing ...

We all have a right to be angry, and I don't question or judge Alex over
this. I appreciate and commend all the dorkbot work. God knows, we need it.
That said, all I wanted to do was to put some intelligent thoughts into the
pot. Lots of things are considered illegal and lots of things are considered
vandalism. Lots of artworks are put into these categories.

Cheers,
Ivan
