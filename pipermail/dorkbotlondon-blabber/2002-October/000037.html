Elaine Freitas:
presents a video from the last performance of her project REFLECT, an 
interactive dance/music work. After the video, she'll go over the 
technical set up for the performance, as well as some aesthetical issues 
that gave birth to the piece. Freitas is a composer in the graduate 
program at Columbia University.

Adam Berenzweig:
Playola: A music similarity browsing system, where you can find new 
music by moving around in a music &quot;space&quot; and listening to songs that 
are nearby in the space. It's audio-based (not based on metadata or user 
contributions) and uses machine learning to model various features like 
genre belongingness, male/female vocal quality, etc. <A HREF="http://www.playola.org">http://www.playola.org</A>
