<PRE>So I got up bright and early to spend a couple of hours cleaning up and
clearing our space and turning soggy boxes of bottles into recyclable
material, to find a highly offensive message spray painted on the side
of our building; the word 'dorkbot' followed by a (back to front)
swastika.

We put a lot of effort into putting dorkbot together, often resulting in
ourselves being unable to fully enjoy the evening ourselves.  The
directors of state51 have been extremely generous in allowing it to be
hosted here at great cost and risk.

So unless the guilty party appears and surfaces, or can otherwise be
tracked down and dealt with, I think it'll be highly unlikely that we'll
be willing to host another dorkbot in the building we work in and love. 
state51 isn't an arts council funded pissing ground; we are a real
company who happen to support worthwhile artists and artistic endevours.

If you happened to see this person spray on our wall or looking
suspicious, please let me know (after asking yourself why you didn't
stop them).

But after all that, an apology from the spray painter would be
gratefully received and met with some level of understanding in return
for the cost of a tin of paint.  I have the receipt right here.

Anyway, until this morning I was pretty buzzed after a great
dorkbotlondon with a great set of talks, hopefully not the last.

Quite a few things were left behind, let me know if you're missing
something from your life.

best,

alex
