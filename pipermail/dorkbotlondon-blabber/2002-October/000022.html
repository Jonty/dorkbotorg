&gt;<i> &gt; Forces of darkness v. art 2002
</I>&gt;<i> which side is the spray tag on? Which side is dorkbot on? which side is
</I>&gt;<i> State51 on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What I was trying to say was that if someone causes aggravation, what they
want is a result. If they get a result, then they go on to do it again. Now,
you may of course argue that getting dorkbot closed down is art, or that
dorkbot is on the side of darkness or whatever.
But I also prefaced this by pointing out that it was not necessarily easy to
know where the spraypainter was coming from and thus hard to judge any
'content' in the incident, apart from the act itself.

(There, I think I nicely covered my butt on all sides).

Cheers,
Ivan
