and the same rhizome occasion also started me thinking about alternates
to that experience which ended with open_digi in South London. Although
my first more or less complete attendance at a state51 dorkbot actually
showed me that dorkbot and open_digi have come up with even more
different solutions/formula than what I had realised I really enjoyed
myself (more than I expected to be totally honest) and surely will be
trying to make it regularly in future.

SO for me more is the pity if this graffitti business disrupts things

when I arrived around 8pm there seemed to be particularly large and
particularly bored set of youth at the other end of the street and
although it is hard to imagine quite how they would have picked up on
'dorkbot' just possibly they might be the culprits for the graffitti?
