<PRE>art/not art
right/wrong
legal/illegal

We probably agree that there is no reason why somthing which is 'illegal' is
also necessarily 'wrong' just as something which is 'legal' is not
necessarily 'right'. 

Is there a principle which states that if something is 'art' then it cannot
also be 'wrong' ?

Is any spraypainter excused because you consider one who spraypaints in
protest against an oppressive regime, greedy  unethical corporation, etc.
to be justified?  

Vandalism as art: 
After ingesting blue gelatin and cake icing on Nov. 2nd, Jubal Brown vomited
on his target, Piet Mondrian's &quot;Composition in Red, White, &amp; Blue&quot; at NYC's
MOMA. Witnessed by a few &quot;lucky&quot; museum patrons, Brown said the event wasn't
stale like the rest of the art in the gallery. It lasted for only a few
minutes &quot;before they brought out the Kleenex and took it away&quot;.
