Aw come on, let the guy have some catharsis. If you woke up and found
your car, home or even work space you were at least some extent
emotionally invested in spraypainted how annoyed &amp; angry would you be?

You've been to one too many poetry readings, mate! It's vandalism, and
it's illegal. The swastika is a symbol of hate (ask a Jew), and bored
teenagers. You're right though, it'd be a huge shame for dorkbot to be
beaten over this.

I fully expect Alex to be releasing some more software into the wild to
catch the perps! Documented in HTML3.2 on
thingsIwouldliketodotothosebastardswhenIcatchthem.com complete with
drag-n-drop kickings sounds from a variety of implements (crowbar,
boot, gideon's bible, ... :-)

Anywaaaayyy...

I wanted to congratulate &amp; thank Alex, Dave, Saul, State 51, the
presenters, and any other folks involved for a really fantastic evening
- that was by far the most enjoyable dorkbot for me. Great shows,
stimulating discussion, friendly people, cheap wine, and of course ace
venue. Long live <A HREF="mailto:dorkbot-london@state51">dorkbot-london@state51</A> :-)

Cheers,
Paul
