SLOW SOUND SYSTEM=20
lie down and be counted=20

'quality avant chillage' BBCi=20

The slow sound system explores the edge of chillout space: digitals, scapes=
, collage and ethnological forgery. Our irregular slow club is a space to r=
ethink ambience, soundscaping and foreground / background listening, and th=
e place to hear some of the best new music in these fields.=20

This month we host the official afterparty for London Headphones festival, =
which takes place from 12pm-12am on July 19. We have three very special gue=
st artists =85=20

Crucial Felix (Crucial Systems, Orthlong) promises a serene solo set on sax=
 and SuperCollider. Better known as Timeblind, Chris Sattinger is one of th=
ose mad scientist types. Living in New York, he releases records on Orthlor=
ng Musork and Tigerbeat6. Originally a classical saxophonist he went throug=
h free jazz, early industrial, acid house and into the global (=93proper=93=
) techno scene. Musically he appropriates sounds from 'New Music', dub, ecs=
tatic jazz, jungle, dancehall and techno. Technically he appropriates from =
classic design patterns, constraint programming, AI and rule-based programm=
ing. Using object databases and AI algorithms, Chris Sattinger captures his=
 own performances, impulses and decisions. These are then refined and dubbe=
d back on themselves to isolate and breed their musical qualities. Chris Sa=
ttinger has played live alongside Richie Hawtin, Sven Vath, Joey Beltram an=
d basically everybody else in techno. Recently he has played shows with Mat=
mos, Kid606, Kit Clayton, Arto Lindsay and Jim O'Rourke.=20

Chris is also playing at Not Clickable, The Foundry on 23 July, where he'll=
 be collaborating with Jem Finer (of 1,000 year Longplayer fame). Make sure=
 you're there ...=20

=93Showing complete irreverence for all the styles of music this record sly=
ly alludes to, Sattinger succeeds in pushing the edge of current electronic=
 music without falling into any kind of genre trap.=93 - kid606=20

=93One of the year's best - and most startling - records.=93 - XLR8R=20

=93... Sattinger carries it out with skill, in the process coming up with a=
 record that sounds unlike anything else.=93 - THE WIRE=20

Slub (fallt, fals.ch) bring us their customised brand of process-based soni=
c improvisations: live generative music using hand-crafted Macintosh and Un=
ix applications (in networked synchrony). With roots in UK electronica and =
tech culture, Slub build their own software environments for creating music=
 in realtime. Only custom composition and DSP software is used - everything=
 you hear is formed by human minds. The result is a rich, multilayered soun=
d; fully controlled, but unpredictable to the point that every performance =
is different.=20

=93... like an army of really pissed off cyborg things bashing their heads =
together inside a big dustbin. Or something ... we, like, like it...=94 (Pl=
ayLouder)=20

On the decks, we welcome back The Legendary Jesse Belle (big chill, sonomu,=
 not clickable). Last time she played at slow sound system she wowed us all=
 with a perfectly balanced set of melancholic, downtempo electronica. Expec=
t more of the same this time round. Don't miss ...=20

Flash workouts, digital stills and slide show manipulations come courtesy o=
f Tom Keene, Jay Ropinsky, the Foundry's CCTV operator and slow sound syste=
m regulars.=20

The show will be simulcast on Resonance 104.4FM from 3-5pm GMT. Set your re=
ceivers, or go to www.resonancefm.com for live streaming audio.=20
