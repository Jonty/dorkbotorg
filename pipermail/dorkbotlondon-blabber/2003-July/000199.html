<PRE>Hello London dorkbots,

We (MakingThings) have presented our stuff at a couple of dorkbot
sessions in our home town of San Francisco. I think we were well
received and the audience seemed to find our presentation interesting
and informative.

One of us (me in fact) will be in London for about 2 weeks at the 
begining of August, and, if possible, I'd love to show you our stuff.
I see you have a meeting in August but that the date has not yet been
determined.

If that's not possible, I'd like to make contact with any individuals
combining mechanical or interactive creations with electronic (computer 
or other) control.

MakingThings makes a line of modular components for interfacing
all sort of electrical devices to a computer. Very simple behavior
can be configured directly into the modules so that a computer is
not required. Advanced behavior can be achieved by attaching a
computer and writing an application in C using our library, or
by using Cycling '74's Max, which is a graphical programming 
environment for music and media applications.

We are working on a module that will run Linux, so that complex
applications developed on a desktop can be pushed down to the module.

More info is available at our website: www.makingthings.com
