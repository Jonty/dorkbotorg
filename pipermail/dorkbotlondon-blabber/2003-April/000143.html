Yes, look at the Linux drivers. I believe that cheapo inkjet printers
now have basically nothing in (PCL is only in laser printers) and have a
native squirt this amount of stuff at the paper in this colour now. HP
released their printer driver sources a while back. I did mean to have a
look to see if there was any visible stuff for the persistent rumours
that the deliberately degrade printing with other manufacturers
cartridges. Its probably just hidden, getting some parameters out of the
chip on the cartridge though.
