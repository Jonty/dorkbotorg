Yeah, would be good. But, I have just moved, and don't know how long I have 
just been at my current location.
I have just had to move from my last address halfway through a broadband 
contract and had to fork out lots of cash. (The phone was in a housemate's 
name, he left the country, so I couldn't just move the connection over. He 
had set up with BT though, which was a mistake from the start ! )

For now, I've been chatting with Paul Makepeace, a dorkbot regular, who 
does offer some pretty good services and is well affordable.
