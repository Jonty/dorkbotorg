<PRE>Hello Dorkbotters,

Apologies for cross-posting.

Some of you may remember the Quack-Project presentation at Dorkbot in 
October last year (the green field with the ducks and cows bouncing up 
and down making music). A few of you were interested in getting hold of 
a copy of it for yourselves.

I'm pleased to announce that the Quack-Project CD was launched at 
Columbia Road Primary School, E2 last Thursday, to a packed audience of 
six year olds - it went down a storm. The CD, available for Macintosh 
and Windows computers, is now available online. It's very reasonably 
priced at UKP10, and features three pieces of software, and two 
electro-acoustic compositions by John Levack Drever and Karlheinz 
Stockhausen, along with extensive writings and essays about the project.

Thanks for your time, and happy quacking.
