Message-ID: <a0521032fba869256b02a@[128.59.116.94]>


hi all,


just a note to let you know that we've extended the ArtBots entry 
deadline until march 15th. we've got a lot of great entries, but we 
heard from some people that they wouldn't be able to get theirs in 
for another few days, so we decided to extend the deadline for 
everyone.

thanks,
douglas
