 By Tube

 Limehouse DLR from Bank or Tower Gateway

 By Bus

 15 from Trafalgar Sq / 115 from Aldgate / D6 from Hackney / D3 from Bethnal
Green

 Get onto Commercial Road and travel East from Aldgate or Whitechapel. Keep
going until you pass Limehouse DLR on your right (you go under the DLR train
bridge) and you'll see a modern red brick church also on the right, then an
 ESSO station on your right, then the library with a statue of Clement
Atlee in front of it, then you'll see the Town Hall, with the Limehouse
Hawksmoor church behind it. At this point you should get off the bus/out of
the car and come ring on the "Boxing Club" bell.
