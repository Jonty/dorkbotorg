<PRE>Hello,

I know you've all been tearing your hair out worrying that there's been no
dorkbotlondon announced for November, but worry no longer, we've been saving
up all our energy, ideas and money for a huge blowout in December.

I know we've annouched Dorkbotlondon's birthday at the last 2 dorkbots, but
(had we bothered to check) we would have realised that *this* (not that) *is
it*. That's right, Dorkbotlondon 12, the birthday special is taking shape,
so get out your diaries, turn to *Saturday* 7th December and scrawl
&quot;dorkbotlondon&quot; in big red crayon over the *whole* evening, and probably the
next few days too, just to be safe.

Details of the all-star international line-up, a formal invitation (it *is*
a birthday), and dress code will follow shortly.

Until then, to stave off withdrawl symptoms of various kinds, a
dorkbotlondonsocial will kick off this wednesday (13th November) from 8pm at
the Golden Heart pub opposite Spitalfields E1.

see you there,

x

saul.
