So I got up bright and early to spend a couple of hours cleaning up and
clearing our space and turning soggy boxes of bottles into recyclable
material, to find a highly offensive message spray painted on the side
of our building; the word 'dorkbot' followed by a (back to front)
swastika.

We put a lot of effort into putting dorkbot together, often resulting in
ourselves being unable to fully enjoy the evening ourselves.  The
directors of state51 have been extremely generous in allowing it to be
hosted here at great cost and risk.

So unless the guilty party appears and surfaces, or can otherwise be
tracked down and dealt with, I think it'll be highly unlikely that we'll
be willing to host another dorkbot in the building we work in and love. 
state51 isn't an arts council funded pissing ground; we are a real
company who happen to support worthwhile artists and artistic endevours.

If you happened to see this person spray on our wall or looking
suspicious, please let me know (after asking yourself why you didn't
stop them).

But after all that, an apology from the spray painter would be
gratefully received and met with some level of understanding in return
for the cost of a tin of paint.  I have the receipt right here.

Anyway, until this morning I was pretty buzzed after a great
dorkbotlondon with a great set of talks, hopefully not the last.

Quite a few things were left behind, let me know if you're missing
something from your life.

best,

alex

Hello,

I know you've all been tearing your hair out worrying that there's been no
dorkbotlondon announced for November, but worry no longer, we've been saving
up all our energy, ideas and money for a huge blowout in December.

I know we've annouched Dorkbotlondon's birthday at the last 2 dorkbots, but
(had we bothered to check) we would have realised that *this* (not that) *is
it*. That's right, Dorkbotlondon 12, the birthday special is taking shape,
so get out your diaries, turn to *Saturday* 7th December and scrawl
"dorkbotlondon" in big red crayon over the *whole* evening, and probably the
next few days too, just to be safe.

Details of the all-star international line-up, a formal invitation (it *is*
a birthday), and dress code will follow shortly.

Until then, to stave off withdrawl symptoms of various kinds, a
dorkbotlondonsocial will kick off this wednesday (13th November) from 8pm at
the Golden Heart pub opposite Spitalfields E1.

see you there,

x

saul.

hold on to your kishkas, its dorkbotlondon's birthday spectacular!

 7pm *Saturday* 7th December, the boxing club, limehouse town hall

people still doing strange things with electricity, but this time, well
classy: the gentle tinkle of champagne flutes, the elegant, candle-lit
surroundings of limehouse town hall, a bleeping mentalist cabaret that's
been plugged into the mains...

entrance free, but  *RSVPRSVPRSVP*

dorkbot is a monthly meeting of people involved in the creation of
electronic art, in the broadest sense of the term.  entrance is free, and
open to all, but this time, due to venue restrictions and limited
availability of seating, candle-lit ambience and waiters, you'll have to
RSVP if you want to come. Please email your name + who else you're bringing
to dorkbot@twenteenthcentury.com if you want to come. First 100 to reply get
in.

international all-star line up... so far.:

- Wilfried Hou Je Bek - http://www.socialfiction.org - Generative
Psychogeography
- Paul Granjon - http://www.zprod.org/ - will be playing the zitare
- Anne Laforet and Christophe Buffet - http://betaville.wkmx.org
- The Marseille Figs - http://www.marseillefigs.org/ (tbc)

+++ opendork (be one!) and more.

sp=187&ism=500&arrow=y?95,157

By Tube
Limehouse DLR from Bank or Tower Gateway

By Bus
15 from Trafalgar Sq / 115 from Aldgate / D6 from Hackney / D3 from
Bethnal Green

Get onto Commercial Road and travel East from Aldgate or Whitechapel. Keep
going until you pass Limehouse DLR on your right (you go under the DLR
train bridge) and you'll see a modern red brick church also on the right,
then a pair of ESSO stations on either side of the street, then the
library with a statue of Clement Atlee in front of it, then you'll see the
Town Hall, with the Limehouse Hawksmoor church behind it. At this point
you should get off the bus/out of the car and come ring on the "Boxing
Club" bell.

ArtBots: The Robot Talent Show
Call for Entries


The second annual international "ArtBots: The Robot Talent Show" will
take place at EYEBEAM Gallery in New York City in mid-July, 2003.
Creators of talented robots are invited to submit their work for
possible inclusion in the show.

The deadline for entries is March 1st, 2003. Please see the ArtBots
website at http://artbots.org for details on how to submit your work.



About ArtBots

ArtBots is an international art exhibition for robotic art and
art-making robots. No firm rules exist on the types of work that can be
submitted; if you think it's a robot and you think it's making art, then
it's an art-making robot. About fifteen submissions will be selected for
participation in the show. The show will run for two days (saturday and
sunday) with all artists in attendence. Selected works will remain
installed during the rest of the week as part of EYEBEAM's summer
robotics festivities.

The first ArtBots show took place in May, 2002, and included the work of
ten artists and groups. Nearly six hundred people visited the show
during its one day run, and the show received very positive coverage in
many print and online publications in the USA and internationally,
including The New York Times, TimeOutNY, BoingBoing.net, and the NASA's
Cool Robot of the Week site. You can access extensive documentation of
the show and participants at: http://artbots.org/2002



ArtBots FAQs:

Q: Is ArtBots a robot competition?
A: Not really, it's more of an art show. However, we do give out two
awards at the end: the "Audience Choice Award" and the "Robots' Choice
Award".

Q: How many participants will be in the show?
A: About fifteen.

Q: I'm not sure if my work qualifies for your show. What exactly are you
looking for?
A: As the name of the show implies, we're looking for work that is some
part art, and some part bot. The meanings of "art" and "bot" are left
open. Possible formats/media include objects, installations, sculpture,
live performance, etc. If you're still not sure, the documentation of
previous participants should give you some idea of the kind of work
we're looking for.

A: Are the artists that participate in the show compensated in any manner?
Q: Unfortunately, no. We provide as much support to the participants as
we can, but ultimately all costs are the responsibility of the artists.
Hopefully this will change in the future.

Q: Do you have an exact date for the show?
A: Not yet. It will be on a weekend in mid-July. We just aren't sure
which one yet. We'll post an update as soon as we know.

Q: Is ArtBots open to people outside of New York City?
A: Of course. However, we're not in a position to offer anything in the
way of support or accommodations for out-of-town participants. (Although
we can probably help you find a place to stay if needed.) The first
ArtBots show featured artists from New York, Boston, Ohio, and Belgium.
We anticipate more geographically diverse entries this year.

Q: Is there a swimsuit competition?
A: No, there is no swimsuit competition.

Q: What's the point of ArtBots? Aren't there enough robot competitions
already?
A: We started ArtBots because we wanted to have fun and to celebrate
some of the creative, non-violent, and not-so-competitive aspects of
robotics. People all over the world are doing interesting, important
work that combines art and robotics; ArtBots is our way of focusing
attention on that work.

Hello,

No dorkbotlondon this month.  Too busy!  And tired.  In rotation.

But!  wednesday 22nd January 2003 (this wednesday coming) we'll meet at
8pm at the Golden Heart pub on commercial road opposite Spitalfields E1.

Last time we went into the smaller of the two bars because it was
nicer.  It is kind of hidden though - from outside the pub, look for a
door to the left of the main doors.  We'll probably be in there.

Please come along if you have an idea for future dorkbotian activities,
or if you just fancy a drink and chat.

see you there,

alex

Hello Dorkbotters,

Apologies for cross-posting.

Some of you may remember the Quack-Project presentation at Dorkbot in 
October last year (the green field with the ducks and cows bouncing up 
and down making music). A few of you were interested in getting hold of 
a copy of it for yourselves.

I'm pleased to announce that the Quack-Project CD was launched at 
Columbia Road Primary School, E2 last Thursday, to a packed audience of 
six year olds - it went down a storm. The CD, available for Macintosh 
and Windows computers, is now available online. It's very reasonably 
priced at UKP10, and features three pieces of software, and two 
electro-acoustic compositions by John Levack Drever and Karlheinz 
Stockhausen, along with extensive writings and essays about the project.

Quack: http://www.kahve-house.com/society/shop/

Thanks for your time, and happy quacking.

hi all,


just a note to let you know that we've extended the ArtBots entry 
deadline until march 15th. we've got a lot of great entries, but we 
heard from some people that they wouldn't be able to get theirs in 
for another few days, so we decided to extend the deadline for 
everyone.

http://artbots.org


thanks,
douglas

It's dorkbotlondon tomorrow/today (Wednesday)...  A cracking line-up,
details up at http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotlondon/ .  

Some of you may remember it being cold at the last winter dorkbot we had
at state51.  However, we're hiring a big space heater which will keep us
toasty warm.  We used one at our xmas party in the dead of winter last
year, and had the warmest party in London.

Finally, if you would like to give a 5 to 7 minute presentation about a
project, an idea, or anything strange with electricity, please let us
know.

One last announcement - in Summer 2004 it seems like there'll be an
international dorkbot camp / festival in Europe - probably Denmark... 
More news as it forms.

See you later,

alex

dearest dorkbots,

So now we've all spent an exhausting month selecting the perfect outfit...
the dorkbot christmas special is almost upon us!

This is just a reminder to those of you who have dutifully subscribed to
the RSVP list that you're names are down and you are getting in, and to
those of you who haven't to get cracking! 40 places left, and they're 
disappearing at a rate of 10 - 20 / day since the weekend.

Oh, and thanks to those of you who have volunteered for the Dorkestra, which
might end up being a dork-chamber ensemble unless there are a few more willing
dokrbots out there willing to make some beepy noises together... Are there any
more? Well, so far we have (at least) a stylophone, a theramin and a trombone
which a damn fine start. What are the rest of you bringing?

There is just one more thing, as you all know, dorkbot is a string and
gaffer-tape affair, sruggling to rub 2 pennies together (especially after too
much champagne) so we can't afford to hire bar staff and door people, nor would
we want to! So what I'm saying is...

-----------------------
Your Dorkbot Needs You!
   
   (pointy finger)

-----------------------

We are looking for 15 wonderful dorkbots to do 1 hour each of bar or door
tending through the evening..

please apply in electronic writing to the recruitment officer:

saul@theps.net

stating your preferred task : door or bar and preferred time of dutifulness:
ie. from 7-8pm to 11-12 pm.

Thank you all for your kind attention, and we look forward welcoming you to
Limehouse Town Hall this Saturday night.

yaaaaay!

dorkbot

Dorkbotlondon,

An special announcement brought with much excitement!

The sprawling network of Dorkbot is teaming up with the READ_ME software
art festival to make the runme-dorkbot city camp.

It'll be in Denmark at the end of August.

Here's the official announcement of the conference.  I understand that
the city camp will follow straight on from the conference.  While the
conference is focused on software art, the runme city camp will have the
usual broad electronic art scope.

More information as it emerges!

     Software Art and Cultures      Runme-Dorkbot
            conference               city camp


-------------------------------------------------------------

The third edition of the Read_Me software art festival will be held 
at the end of August 2004 in Aarhus, Denmark. Read_me 2004 will 
consist of the conference at Aarhus University and the city camp 
organized by two friendly entities: Runme.org and Dorkbot. The 
conference and the city camp will be held consecutively.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is an announcement concerning the Software Art and Cultures 
conference. The information on the Runme-Dorkbot city camp will 
follow later.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Software Art and Cultures conference aims to provide an opportunity for
people researching software art and culture to share their findings. The
art movement known by the name "software art" has been active for a few
years, and similar phenomena under different names have been  developed
and researched for a few decades. It is our belief that there is a
sufficient body of thinking in this and related areas taking place that
there should be a platform for aiding further discovery and enrichment.

Software art is a practice that regards software as a cultural 
phenomenon that defines one of the significant aspects of our lives 
today. Thus, software is not regarded as an invisible layer, but 
rather as a significant entity contributing to reproduction or change 
of certain orders, whether aesthetic, cultural, social or political. 
Software art creatively questions and redefines software and its ways 
of functioning.

Software art embraces a wide range of practices: from formalist 
experiments with code and its execution to software manipulation that 
does not require any specific knowledge, from alternative tools built 
from scratch to add-ons and deconstructions, from real software to 
projects not written in programming languages at all, but which deal 
with issues relevant to software criticism or culture. Software art
deals with a wide range of topics, including  social, political, and
aesthetic issues. In many cases, it addresses and becomes part of
software culture itself.

Software cultures - cultures generated by programmers, designers and 
software users - are generous sources of thinking on digital culture 
and society. Software cultures define the way software is created and 
functions, thus influencing the composition and function of the basic 
infrastructures of digital society. In this way, software cultures
become inseparable  (though largely underestimated) from the forms
digital work, social institutions and cultural manifestations take
today. Software cultures initiate social change, act in political
spheres, create and discover new artistic realms and methodologies.

The conference encourages participation of specialists in various 
disciplines: multi-disciplinary researchers including non-academics, 
art theorists, and other thinkers and learners interested in the 
effects of software and software cultures on art, culture, and 
society - and in ways to analyze them and challenge existing patterns.

This is a call for submissions of abstracts (up to 2500 characters). 
Authors of accepted abstracts will be asked to submit the full paper 
before 1 of June, 2004 (up to 25000 characters) and present it during

We aim to provide grants for travel and lodging for speakers without 
institutional backing.

Hello,

For those in Berlin, including those at the Transmediale festival,
there's the first dorkbot.bin at c-base (http://c-base.org) on Monday
from 7pm.  Come over if you're in town.

Also if you have something you'd like to present - an idea, project or
whatever, please come along and do that.  We have plenty space for 5-10
minute 'opendork' presentations.  If you want to give a longer
presentation that might be possible but best get in contact first.

Cheers!

alex

dorks,

The runme/dorkbot city camp (on 25-27 August 2004) is preceded by the
excellent READ_ME conference (on 23-24 August 2004).  There'll
undoubtedly be a lot of crosstalk between them.

If you're coming to the city camp, why not stay for the two days before,
and submit a last-minute abstract to READ_ME?

There have been a lot of submissions, but if you are also planning to
stay for the city camp then that would count in your favour...

The runme/dorkbot citycamp will be a meeting of dorkbot minds from
around the globe, with informal talks, workshops and other opportunities
to do strange things with electricity.  More info soon!

Dearest dorkbots,

on the first day of proper sun, it feels appropriate to announce and
invite you all to come to Aarhus, Denmark, for the great dorkbot/runme
summer gathering for 2004. 

it would be good to discuss possible presentations and further events on
the dorkbotlondon-blabber list.. 

I really hope you can all make it. It's a dorkbot landmark.

oh, btw, there's travel bursaries for the skint, but if you're flush,
please feel free to dish your dosh into the pot.

X!

S.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
You are cordially invited to leave your tents and sleeping bags safely
at home and join us in Aarhus, Denmark for the Runme Dorkbot citycamp
2004. From the 25th-27th August, Aarhus will be filled with 'people
doing strange things with software', as well as more traditional
campfire activities such as eating, drinking, talking, socialising,
showing off and relaxing together. 
 
The citycamp will be an informal gathering of people interested in
software and art where citycampers will be free to do some low-key
research, develop code and ideas, talk to interesting people and enjoy
dorkbot-style presentations (5-20 minute presentations with feedback
sessions), performances and parties.
 
The Aarhus' Jutland Academy of Fine Arts has kindly donated use of a
cozy building for these purposes. We will not, however, actually be
camping there; but the basic accommodation for the citycampers will be
taken care of (for those who have registered with a presentation or
other activity).

The R&D camp is brought to you by runme.org and dorkbot.org, but even if
you've never heard of these groups, you are most welcome to come, see
and show: all you need to do is register yourself as a participant here
or as a visitor here. You are, of course, welcome to come without prior
registration (either as a participant or as a visitor), but there is a
chance that we won't allow you in because the space is full. We'll give
preference to those ones registered... The deadline for registration is
June 15.
 
There are already some plans in the works: a live programming sound/code
clash, software vj mega-jam, installation works, and (for the intrepid)
a pre-citycamp cycle tour of Europe taking in sites of geeky interest.
However, there is plenty of space for more suggestions for events,
projects and recreation. If you have some ideas, please let us know.
 
Also, we are distributing this invitation to people and channels we are
familiar with, if you know someone or somewhere interesting that we have
missed out, please redistribute this invitation.
 
We look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you around the city
campfire in Denmark this summer!
