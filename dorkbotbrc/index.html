<h1>Welcome to dorkbot: Black Rock City!</h1>

<p>
Every great city should have a dorkbot event every month.
Black Rock City only exists for one week each year,
so we are planning for a whole week of informal dorkbot presentations.
This will bring together dorkbotters from all over the world.
MathCamp at Group W will provide a new and expanded Sierpinski lecture hall,
complete with sound and video conveniently located at e at pi.

<p>
Are you an artist/technologist that gets inundated with, "how does
that work?", "How much propane does it consume?,"  " What kind of
processor did you use?"  Well, now you can reply, "I'll tell you all
about it at dorkbotBRC on Thursday at pi time."
</p>

schedule in "Who What When."
