We opened           the performance portion of the festival by kicking off the first of           it's three days. This time around we had three very good presenters           who brought their own unique style of the audio arts to present to the           audience a diverse look the electronic music and electronic story telling.         </p>        <p>There were two common bounds between these presenters:</p>        <p>1) As far as electronics were concerned - we had one low tech, one           high tech, and one in the middle.</p>        <p>2) Each told a story.</p>        <p>The first presenter, Brian Schorn, performed &quot;an episode of little           consequence.&quot; This work was written as a narrative which incorporated           manipulated vocals and a dynamic sonic arrangement. His sounds originated           from rocks, a flute, and an assortment of digital manipulated sound           samples.</p>        <p>Jeff Karolski performed an intimate piece that let the listener share           a conversation with his grandmother while he was suffering with a cold.           Folowing the conversation, our Jeff took a contemplative moment which           was expressed in the amplification of a ringing wine glass before going           back to see his grandmother to complete the task he came there to do,           fix her hearing aid.</p>        <p>Chris Landau the audience decide how to navigate the web based science           fiction story, The Flocking Party. Laser pointers were distributed through           out the audience who then used them to point to what they were reading           or looking at. Chris would then click on the interactive elements were           ever the main body of the &quot;flock&quot; moved to. The story itself           took place in the future and audio portion of the story was reactive           to where the reader's mouse was on the screen.</p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><strong><a href="detroit06.html">Photos of the session</a></strong></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>Below are the bios for each performer:<br>        </p>        <p><strong>Brian Schorn:</strong></p>        <p>Interdisciplinary artist, Brian Schorn, composes and performs experimental           electronic, computer and electro-acoustic music while integrating video,           performance art, installation art and poetry.<br>          <br>          Schorn received an MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media at Mills           College in Oakland, California.

With a foundation paved by a personal tape recorder,           today Jeff has been realizing his work through more temporary experiences           such as performance and/or interactive processes in a variety of different           contexts.<br>          <br>          Notable works: opening the first DEMF &quot;playing&quot; a model-builder's           table saw along with a fly trapped inside his bathroom, a 10 year collection           of answering machine message tapes found at thrift stores installed           at DUMBO Art Space in Brooklyn, a commissioned outdoor performance at           the DIA mid-winter where Jeff took off his shirt and shoes to conduct           the cold resulting in the amplification of his teeth chattering on a           microphone element while cars driving by triggered a space heater, and           a performance marching through NYC's Central Park with a Hypersonic           Speaker projecting the sound of a parade at park-goers. (The sound from           this speaker projects like light from a flashlight, so only the person           who it's being pointed at can hear it.) </p>        <p><a href="http://www.woodcheese.com">http://www.woodcheese.com</a></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><strong>Chris Landau:</strong></p>        <p>Chris Landau is currently finishing his MFA thesis at the University           of Michigan, School of Art and Design, and he received his BFA in Printmaking           from the Cleveland Institute of Art. Chris&#8217;s creative work ranges           from traditional to digital media in projects that bridge scientific           visualization and fine art. His current written work is a synthesis           of both media theory and cognitive evolution.<br>          <br>          Chris&#8217;s most recent project, <a href="http://www.theflockingparty.com">theflockingparty.com</a>,           brings many of his favorite themes together, living systems, multi-linear           narrative, and speculative technologies. He has also begun illustrating           a cognitive psychology book by the esteemed psychologist, Steven Kaplan.           In addition, he will be creating an animation of yeast cell development           for Organelle View, a project that visualizes the protein database created           by Kumar Lab at the University of Michigan. Upon graduation, Chris plans           on moving to Philadelphia to be with his wife and start a company that           feeds his interest in the life sciences and digital media through inventive           forms of visualization.</p>        <p><a href="http://www.theflockingparty.com">http://www.theflockingparty.co</a></p>        </td>    </tr>  </table></div><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></body></html>
