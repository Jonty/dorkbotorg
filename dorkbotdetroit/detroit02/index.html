The evening began with Flint, MI based artist, Adam Mokan, introducing           us to the basics of circuit bending as well as giving us a look inside           some of his projects and showing us how they work. Adam then teamed           up with Steev Thompson for a noise performance using their circuit bent           instruments.</p>        <p>Steve Curtin presented his ever growing project involving PLLs and           PIC microprocessor based frequency generators. His performance then           took the audience to the other end of the sound spectrum with his droned           and layered audio.</p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><strong><a href="http://www.m00k13.com/">Adam Mokan</a></strong><br>          -is a software developer, experimental musician, and all-around dork           <br>          based out of Flint, Michigan. Since an early age, Adam has been an avid           tinkerer <br>          and electronics hobbiest. Adam has salvaged parts from old arcade consoles,           <br>          kids toys, and more to create and array of sound generators and effects.           He <br>          tours and performs using these instruments with his noise/jam project           called <br>          8-Bit Porno. He also maintains several solo and collaborative projects           and runs the<br>          small experimental label called <a href="http://www.russolo.com">Russolo's           Brain</a>.</p>        <p><img src="images/adam.jpg" width="133" height="200"> <a href="http://projects.dorkbot.org/dorkbotdetroit/021805_a/adamSteev.mp3">Listen           to Adam and Steev's performance.</a><br>        </p>        <p><strong><a href="http://www.xdiedenroutey.net">Steev Thompson</a></strong><br>          Michigan-based experimental musician that runs a label <br>          called '<a href="http://www.xdiedenroutey.net">xdiedenroutey</a>' and           is part of a noise project called Athenian Mercury <br>          and also a solo project called Roxanne Jean Polise, among others. </p>        <p><img src="images/steev.jpg" width="200" height="133"> <a href="http://projects.dorkbot.org/dorkbotdetroit/021805_a/adamSteev.mp3">Listen           to Adam and Steev's performance.</a><br>        </p>        <p><a href="http://curtin.emf.org/"><strong>Steven Curtin</strong></a><br>          A hybrid musician/engineer.

At Dorkbot he will be presenting           his latest <br>          project involving PLLs and PIC microprocessor based frequency generators           for just <br>          intonation and other tunings. </p>        <p><img src="images/steve.jpg" width="200" height="133"> <a href="http://projects.dorkbot.org/dorkbotdetroit/021805_a/steveC.mp3">Listen           to Steve's performance.</a></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>These musicians have a unique bond with their instruments in that they           have worked with them from the inside and ultimately have created the           sound that is produced. Atheistically it was interesting to juxtapose           Adam Mokan and Steev Thompson with Steve Curtin since the audio that           both created were opposite ends of the performance spectrum. Both use           the same basic electronic techniques to create their instruments, but           the sounds that are produced go into very different realms.</p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><a href="http://projects.dorkbot.org/dorkbotdetroit/021805_p">View           pictures and videos of the session.</a></p>        </td>    </tr>  </table></div><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></body></html>
