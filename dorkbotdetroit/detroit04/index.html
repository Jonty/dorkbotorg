That person's signal would then be passed to the next person           and so on. Could we control the audio? Would it be just noise? How many           people could we get to show up? At the fourth dorkbot we gave it a shot           and a great time doing it. It was held at Green Brain Comics in Dearborn,           MI on the day before Labor Day, 2005.</p>        <p>There was a total of seven participants. The devices that they brought           ranged from Flanger pedals, Echo Boxes, cordless telephones, to digital           effects processors. We tried different audio sources - electric keyboards,           voice, and AM Radio - to explore which source had the best sound qualities           and dynamic range to produce a quality audio piece.</p>        <p>To hear what each person was contributing to the audio output, each           participant introduced their effects to the audio chain one by one starting           from as minimal of an effect as their device would let them get. We           also attempted to see how the overall sound would be ny just having           certain portions of the chain manipulating the audio, while others went           as minimal as possible.</p>        <p>Phase One Participants were (in order on the chain):</p>        <p>Jeff Karolski - <a href="http://www.woodcheese.com">www.woodcheese.com</a><br>          Brian Schorn - <a href="http://www.circulus.us/">www.circulus.com</a><br>          Diesel Sam - <a href="http://www.phallusuberalles.net">www.phallusuberalles.net</a><br>          Remy - <a href="http://www.phallusuberalles.net">www.phallusuberalles.net</a><br>          Sarah Stopera<br>          Curtis Paul - <a href="http://www.abusedcurrent.org/">www.abusedcurrent.org</a><br>          Charlie Pearson - <a href="http://www.proletariats.com/">www.proletariats.com</a></p>        <p>non-chain participant:</p>        <p>Jason Engling - <a href="http://bubblegone.cyclene.com">bubblegone.cycylene.com</a></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>Be on the watch for more signal processing chains as we are going to           give it a few more tries.</p>        <p><strong>Below are couple audio samples from the session.
