Welcome to dorkbotsv, the new dorkbot chapter for Silicon Valley! &nbsp;Since
we are brand-new, and are just getting started, we are currently still in
the mode of finding a meeting space, to get things going.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
So...if there are any folk out there familiar with South Bay venues both for meetings
and for perfomances, and can provide a few suggestions, it would be greatly
appreciated. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;<font color="#ffffff">dorkbotsv is an every-other-month meeting
of artists (sound/image/movement/whatever), designers, engineers, students
and other interested parties from the southern bay area california / silicon
valley area who are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the broadest
sense of the term.) the purpose of dorkbotsv is to:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * give artists/programmers/engineers an opportunity for informal &nbsp; &nbsp; peer review<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * establish a forum for the presentation of new art &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; works/technology/software/hardware<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * help establish relationships and foster collaboration between people with various backgrounds and interests<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * give us all a chance to see the cool things that our neighbors are working on.<br>
      <br>
imaginary presentation topics:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a demo of the new motion tracking software you're writing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * playing a video you made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * an explanation of how you hacked your game boy to get it to make cool bleeping noises<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * trouble shooting/brainstorming your remote-controlled sandwich making robot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * bringing in some dancers you're working with and having
them demonstrate the interface used in your new mind-control ballet<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * discussing your approach to electronic sculpture<br>
      <br>
demos of commercial software are not appropriate, unless you wrote the software
or you are making it do something particularly novel or interesting. on the
other hand, presenting a piece that was created using commercial software
is fine.<br>
dorkbotsv meetings are free and open to the public. space at some events
may be limited, so you are encouraged to rsvp to help us make adequate arrangements
for each event. rsvp at: dorkbotsv@dorkbot.org</font><br>

      <font color="#ffffff"><big><big>Where/When</big></big><br>
      <br>
Still in our beginnings, so likely will be a "moveable feast" for the moment.</font><big><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><big>How</big><br>
      <br>
      </font></big><font color="#ffffff">to attend a dorkbotsv meeting, just
show up and hope there's room. to give a presentation at a meeting please
email Jordan at wyvernshade-at-yahoo-dot-com. please see below for details on presentation format.</font><br>

      <br>
dorkbotsv meetings are largely informal, but to save everyone time and energy
a certain amount of planning will go into each meeting. the current structure
for presentation/demo events is:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * brief intros, announcements, administrative details<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* final comments/debate/etc.<br>
      <br>
which means that each meeting is about an hour long and features two presentations.
on the other hand, "open hack" -type events will be more free-form: just
bring your stuff, work on it (or show it) and get feedback.<br>
      <br>
      <big><big>Resources</big></big><br>
      <br>
please be prepared to give your presentation with only the resources you bring with you.<br>
