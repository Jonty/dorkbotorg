<!--<h3>Andrew Johnstone and Michael Michael - <i>Decoding Black Rock City</i></h3>
The Burning Man Earth Project is a group project aimed at  
acquiring, disseminating and documenting Burning Man event information  
at a grass roots level. Burning Man Earth will attempt to archive the  
event "in amber" employing a banquet of various geotagged media and  
information, from maps, photos and video, to exotics such as gigapan,  
gps tracks, 3d models, hi res aerial and even soundscapes. It can  
further be employed as a framework to a georeferenced social network  
and participant planning tool. Our latest project is employing iPhone  
technology to write an application that will allow users in the desert  
the ability to access interactive geo data to expand the playa  
experience and create digital transparency among the citizens of Black  
Rock City.

<h3>Moldover - <i>The Mojo-69: Musical Instrument FROM THE FUTURE</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>

<h3>Dave Mathews - <i>SOFTware is the new HARDware</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>
Purpose built electronics have gone way to generic "do it all" platforms like DSPs and low cost processors within inexpensive netbooks, iPhone and Android mobile platforms, etc.  What used to require expensive prototyping and manufacturing can often be built with software created in your lap.  Here's a look at some inventions that raised hundreds of millions of dollars and can now be built and launched for next to nothing.
<p>
Dave Mathews is a consumer product expert specializing in the convergence of digital and entertainment devices. He holds nearly 40 U.S. patents and has appeared as a tech expert or host on some 300 television shows.  Dave is a contributor to Ziff Davis' PC Magazine, O'Reilly's MAKE and other consumer-tech outlets as well as industry publications.
<p>
As a "white space inventor" Dave has helped companies such as Cloud Engines' PogoPlug, boxee, Sling Media's Slingbox, Radio Shack Corporation and Cypher Optics launch one of a kind innovative products.  He was co-founder of Digital Convergence corporation, creator of the Cue Cat - a first consumer bar code reader and its associated CRQ "television to web" technologies.  He's always looking for that next big idea.
