</p><h3>Mark Meadows - <i>We Robot</i></h3>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
Mark Stephen Meadows, author of "We, Robot" rants about artificial intelligence, chatbots, and why waiting for the singularity is like waiting for the Tooth Fairy. He covers how search engines and social media are merging, how these systems will be used in games and social media, and he dissects a working example of such a critter (which he built) and explains why it, like Siri, will listen very, very carefully to what you have to say.
<p>
Mark Stephen Meadows is President of Simple Machine, a company that develops conversational characters and virtual assistants. An American author, inventor, artist, and speaker, he has written four books that decode technology, AI, and robots.  An early developer of the Internet and 3D technologies has worked at top research labs including Xerox-PARC, SRI, the Waag, and others.  He is also a  certified US Coast Guard Captain, is able to spit over three meters and, if properly inspired, dance until dawn.

<h3>Tony Parisi - <i>WebGL From the Front Lines</i></h3>
WebGL is on the move: we gots apps, tools, frameworks and devices aplenty. No longer "the future," a "flash in the pan," some "dumbass idea" or "a solution looking for a problem," 3D on the web has hit the mainstream. It's shipped, it's everywhere and it's fun. Catch the latest in a status report from author, entrepreneur and 3DOG Tony Parisi.
<p>
Tony Parisi is an entrepreneur and career CTO/architect. He has developed international standards and protocols, created noteworthy software products, and started and sold technology companies. Tony's passion for innovating is exceeded only by his desire to bring coolness and fun to the broadest possible audience.
<p>
Tony's first startup, Intervista Software (1995-1998), developed the first-ever real-time VRML plugin for Internet Explorer, which Microsoft bundled with millions of copies of their browser. His most recent company, Vivaty (2007-2010), created a novel end-to-end virtual world system fully integrated with the web and serving up millions of virtual goods transactions.
<p>
Tony is perhaps best known for his work as a pioneer of 3D standards for the web. He is the co-creator of VRML and X3D, ISO standards for networked 3D graphics. Tony continues to build community around innovations in 3D as the co-chair of the <a href=http://www.meetup.com/webgl-developers-meetip/>WebGL Meetup</a> and a founder of the <a href=http://www.rest3d.org/>Rest3D working group</a>. Tony is also the author of O'Reilly media book <a href=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024729.do>WebGL Up and Running</a>.
<p>
Tony is currently a partner in a stealth online gaming startup and has a consulting practice developing social games, virtual worlds and location-based services for San Francisco Bay Area clients.

<h3>Jim Ellis - <i>DIY SYNTH OVERVIEW: The New romanticism of Synth DIY Hardware 2012</i></h3>
David Tudor, Bruce Haack, Raymond Scott, Serge Tcherepnin, Don Buchla and Robert Moog are legends of the electronic music field. We know some as musicians and others as inventors, all were hands on circuitry designers and builders. "Pop" electronic musicians Chris Watson, Ralf HÃ¼tter, and Cris Carter all built custom electronic instruments and processors for themselves and their bandmates. This tradition of building new, modified and custom electronic music gear has carried over to the present and has been given a push forward by what seems to be a  mega wave of new modular synth enthusiasts.
<p>
 This talk will be a primer covering some aspects of this vast field.

<h3>Mike Kuniavsky - <i>The New Product Development Ecosystem: How to reinvent manufacturing so that it is more socially and ecologically responsible, creates cooler stuff, and is run by makers</i></h3>
<p>
Imagine a world 8 years from now where instead of a warehouse, Amazon is a factory. Products are made in small quantities, as needed, based on direct input from users to designers and developers. In this world design directly drives product creation, and data informs design. Consumer products are made locally, with local materials and workers, while at the same time being able to use design and engineering talent from anywhere on earth. It simultaneously looks exactly like our world, but is totally different.
<p>
Mike Kuniavsky is a designer focused on ubiquitous computing user experience design. He co-founded Adaptive Path, an influential design firm, and ThingM, a micro-OEM. His books on user experience design research ("Observing the User Experience") and the design of novel computing devices ("Smart Things") are widely used as university textbooks. He founded and hosts the annual Sketching in Hardware summit on the design of digital hardware toolkits for agile hardware development, interaction design, and art.
