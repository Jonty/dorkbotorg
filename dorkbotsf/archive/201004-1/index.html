<!--<h3>Tim Hunkin - <i>Tim Hunkin's Recent Arcade Machines</i></h3>
Includes Fly Drive (a simulator where you are a fly, trying to eat as much as possible without getting swotted). Also Whack a Banker (an enhanced version of wackamole) and the coin operated nuclear reactor he is building at the moment.
<p>
Tim Hunkin trained as an engineer, but then became a cartoonist (drawing a strip for a UK sunday paper called The Rudiments of Wisdom for 15 years). His next career was in television (writing and presenting three series called The Secret Life of Machines for Channel 4). For the next ten years he worked for museums, building interactive exhibits and curating and designing exhibitions. He is currently obsessed with his amusement arcade on Southwold pier.

<h3>Todd Huffman - <i>The Front Lines of Geek Imperialism</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>
Imperialism -- extending influence, building empires.  It's been done
by the Persians, Romans, British, French, Russians, McDonalds and CNN.
Can we, the geeks, build a kinder, gentler, and more enlightened
world through propagating our ideas, ideals and methods?  Come see a
first-person perspective of cultural and technological shifts across
the globe, and what can and should be done as we humans move forward.
<p>
Todd Huffman is a freelance technologist, ranging across biology,
mobile technology, communications, and the developing world.

<h3>Eric Gradman - <i>The Cloud Mirror:  Your Virtual Self is Leaking</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>
You gaze into the Cloud Mirror, and it gazes deep into you. It will
violate your privacy, especially if you carelessly litter the Internet
with sensitive personal details.
The Cloud Mirror is an art piece which temporarily merges visitors'
online identities with their physical selves. It uses augmented
reality, computer vision, accesses many Internet web services in
parallel using cloud computing resources to identify visitors by name;
mine the Internet for photographs and facts (dirt) about them; and
superimpose that data in an on-screen comic book thought bubble that
follows them onscreen.
<P>
Eric will talk a little about the interactive art that's been
coming out of SyynLabs in Los Angeles, and the games that have been
coming out of the Virsix Game Lab.
<p>
Eric Gradman is an interactive artist in Los Angeles, CA. His work
often features computer vision, large-scale projections, unusual
sensors, and custom electronics to produce fun environments that
compel people to interact.
<p>
He is a frequent speaker on robotics and interactive systems. He is
co-founder of Virsix, an immersive entertainment company in Los
Angeles; SyynLabs, a Los Angeles-based tech-art collective; and a
founding member of Crashspace LA, Los Angeles' first hackerspace.
<p>
Eric's work has been seen at various conferences and events, including
Sundance Film Festival, Los Angeles Brewery ArtWalk, TEDxUSC,
TEDxBerkeley, Opportunity Green Conference, Los Angeles County Museum
of Art (LACMA), BIL, TEDActive, and the Los Angeles Hammer Museum.

<h3>Annalee Newitz - <i>Revenge of the Meatsack, Or Four Arguments Against Immortality</i></h3>
A lot of science fiction promises us a future where we
are immortal, enhanced posthumans. And scientists are trying to make
that happen. But immortality isn't all that it's cracked up to be. In
this presentation I'll offer four arguments against immortality, both
as a scientific/technical phenomenon and a social goal.
<p>
Annalee Newitz writes about science, technology, and pop culture.
Currently she's the editor in chief of io9.com, a blog about science
fiction and the future. She's published articles in Wired, 2600, The
Washington Post, New Scientist, Popular Science, and the San Francisco
Bay Guardian. She's the author of Pretend We're Dead: Capitalist
Monsters In American Pop Culture, and the co-editor of the essay
collection She's Such A Geek. Formerly, she was the policy analyst at
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and a lecturer in American Studies
at UC Berkeley. She was the recipient of a Knight Science Journalism
Fellowship at MIT.
