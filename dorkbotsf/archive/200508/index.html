<h3>Jill Miller - <i>How to Hunt for Bigfoot: Satellites, Solar Power, and Triangles</i></h3>
San Francisco-based artist Jill Miller is participating in Norwich
Gallery's EAST 05 international exhibition, July 2 - August 20, 2005, which
was curated by Gustav Metzger. Miller's durational performance-installation,
"Waiting for Bigfoot," is located in a remote Northern California forest
where Bigfoot has been spotted hundreds of times. A live camera feed will be
delivered to the internet via satellite uplink, 24 hours a day. The entire
campsite is powered by solar energy. She will live at the campsite, situated
in the epicenter of Bigfoot sightings, for the duration of EAST 05. She will
be in San Francisco for a brief break from Bigfoot hunting to speak at
dorkbot.
<p>
<b>Jill Miller</b> received her MFA from UCLA in 2004. She is currently
Visiting Faculty in New Genres at the San Francisco Art Institute. Her work
has been exhibited and collected internationally. She is the recipient of
numerous grants, most recently an Arts Council England Award. In 2006, a
video installation based on her experiences waiting for Bigfoot will appear
in the touring exhibition "Cryptozoology: Out of Time Place Scale," curated
by Mark Bessire.

<h3>Scott Minneman and Dale MacDonald (Onomy Labs) - <i>Make-Tanks: a New Paradigm for Innovation</i></h3>
<p>
The past century saw the emergence of corporate and military "think-tank"
laboratories as a dominant site for technological innovation.  The
"Make-Tank" is a more grounded alternative to this model, firmly rooted in
the belief that tinkering and hands-on experimentation is pivotal in
discovering the potentials of emerging technologies and scientific
discoveries.  Make-Tanks existed before this period (in another Menlo Park,
for instance), lurked in garages during, and are again on the rise, even as
corporate research funding is on the wane.
<p>
Onomy Labs, this month's dorkbotSF host, is one such Make-Tank.
Working with text, graphics, images, computing, sensors, actuators, and
mechanicals, the Onomy crew makes novel interactive storytelling devices for
use in hands-on learning settings, trade shows, showrooms, and back into
corporate laboratories.  They will talk a little bit about the make-tank paradigm shift, what technologies and tools are fueling that re-emergence, tell war stories about projects and the technological developments they embody, and do tours and demos of the various devices they have at the lab, including the Tilty and
Twisty Tables, an Interactive Wall, hopefully a supercharged 1959 Philco
Predicta.
<P>
<b>Scott Minneman</b> is fascinated by the practice of interdisciplinary design and
the physicality of innovation.  This manifests itself in his own background
of architectural and engineering design (BA, BS, and MS from MIT; PhD from
Stanford), embedded systems, interactive video, installation art, and rock
climbing.  At Xerox PARC from 1987 until 2001, Scott explored the nature of
collaborative design and the potential for video/audio/computing systems to
support design processes, focusing on design communications and shared
drawing.  Scott has also worked on interactive robotics for the physically
challenged, and communication aids for non-vocal and deaf individuals.  As a
scientist-collaborator in the PARC Artist-In-Residence (PAIR) program, Scott
did installations at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco,
The Friends of Photography, a Sony JumboTron on the facade of a nightclub on
Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, SIGGRAPH, and a single-wide mobile home in
Goleta, CA.  He has coached a FIRST robotics team in Palo Alto for 8 years,
and helped Singapore launch their FIRST robotics contest.  He co-founded
Onomy Labs in 2002, a company of folks who imagine and construct novel
interactive devices for collaborative sensemaking settings (like museums),
and who shepherd technologies out of laboratories into the hands of everyday
people.  He is Onomy's CTO, and does the mechanical engineering and art
direction on most projects.
<p>
<b>Dale MacDonald</b> is breathless from an adult life navigating a complex ecology
of art/science/design/engineering, semiconductor process development,
pioneering work in large area electronics, electronic music and performance
art, lighting design for dance and opera, technology infused explorations of
light, space and image, connecting unusual devices (car alarm key fobs,
accelerometers, file cabinets, crystal
balls) to multimedia to enable content-specific-form storytelling machines.
He is Onomy's CFO, and does the core of the programming and systems design
on most projects.
