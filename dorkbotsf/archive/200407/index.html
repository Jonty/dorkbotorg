<h3>Scott Kildall - <i>Computer-controlled Fire Art</i></h3>
Scott Kildall will discuss three separate fire installations he has
worked on for Burning Man from 2001-2003: The Play Plane Crashground,
The Octopus Car and The Pyrocycles. He will demonstrate and detail
basic flamethrower design, show video of some of the projects and
discuss use of embedded systems to control fire systems. The end of the
talk will conclude with a demonstration of last year's project, The
Pyrocycles.
<p>
Scott Kildall builds sculpture, always performative and interactive in
nature, and has shown his work at many galleries and underground venues
in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has also designed several fire-based
installations to wide acclaim at the Burning Man festival. His
technical expertise includes welding, editing video, programming
microcontrollers, building electronics and developing controlled
pyrotechnic systems. His is committed to expanding access to arts
through teaching, leading collaborative projects and drawing upon
specialized knowledge of colleagues. He is currently an instructor at
The Crucible in the Kinetics department and currently works out of a
studio at an undisclosed location in the Bayview District of San
Francisco.

<h3><i>The Shipyard Circle of Dork</i></h3>

<i>"I had not anticipated that the work would present any great
difficulites . . ."</i>
<p>
- Sir Ernest Shackleton, South pole explorer, 1915.
<p>
At the Shipyard, fire and metal arts meet gearhead geek
culture...here's a round-robin look at what's fresh off the slab at
the Shipyard, including (but not limited to)these current projects:
<p>
- Jim Mason: Shipyard intro
<br>
- Jake Lyall: The Riot Wheel (mono wheel land speed record attempt)
<br>
- Scott Bartlett: home-made jet engine
<br>
- Tom McCarty and peef:  the Shipyard's off-the-grid power system
<br>
- hazmatt (Matthew Snyder): EST (Experiments in Spherical
Transportation) geodesic spheres with internal vehicles
<br>
- Kiki Pettit: Firefall demo
<br>
- Ryon Gesink: FuckMachine
<br>
<p>
afterdork may or may not include the F*%K Machine, vendodemo,
video/works of artist-in-residence Barry Schwartz, and other
events...
<p>
The Shipyard is a collaborative build space for large-scale
mechanical, kinetic and electronic artwork. With 27 shipping
containers arrayed around the perimenter of a 11,000 sq ft outdoor
lot, the Shipyard provides a flexible space to create ambitious
large-scale art and technology projects- projects that are often
difficult to realize in typical indoor warehouse spaces.
<p>
Each citizen of The Shipyard has his/her own shipping container(s)
where they can store materials and/or set up small shops and
studios. The large center open air courtyard is a shared space where
 they can store materials and/or set up small shops and
studios. The large center open air courtyard is a shared space where
people can spread out temporarily when working on bigger efforts.
This combination of small dedicated shop areas with a large shared
space gives everyone access to significant acreage to build, while
at the same time maintaining core resources in personally controlled
work spaces.
