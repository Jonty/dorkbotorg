</p><h3>Alan Rorie - <i>HOW TO: Build a Rocketship Engine</i></h3>
The Uira Engine exists at the boundary of art and science. It is simultaneously a sculpture and experiment, an exploration of science fiction and fact. It is a kinetic high-voltage sculpture of a rocketship engine that serves as an experimental platform for a novel high-voltage phenomenon.
<p>
Dr. Alan Rorie (aka Almsot Scientific) is a designer, artist and scientist whose work focuses on the intersection between science, art and education. He founded Almost Scientific, a science and art collaborative, after someone told him his method of working was "very scientific." "I know how science works," he replied. "This isn't scientific -it's almost scientific."

<h3>Aaron Ross - <i>Home Movies from the Noosphere: Representing Inner Perceptions</i></h3>
3D computer graphics and simulation technologies have a profound impact on consciousness, the full implications of which are not yet widely grasped. CGI is a new form of media capable of synthesizing all previous media. It's a communications technology revolution as important as the cave painting or the printing press. For the first time in history, humans are capable of creating full-motion, interactive simulations of nearly anything imaginable. This means our ability to communicate is now limited only by our imagination. And yet, popular media still cling to the familiar. Advanced imaging technologies are used for anthropomorphic representations in a conventional narrative-- this year's comic book superhero on the big screen. What if the untapped imaginative power implicit in CGI were turned inward to represent the ineffable visions of individual consciousness? Is it possible to convert the deepest, most subjective personal experience to a form that can be shared, stored, edited, re-experienced? This talk, and the experimental animation PHOSPHENES, explores that possibility.
<p>
Aaron F. Ross is a video artist, author, and educator. His abstract computer animation has screened at prestigious festivals and venues such as SIGGRAPH, ISEA, and Berlin Interfilm. Over the years he has worked professionally in various video production roles: producer, director, videographer, 3D computer animator, editor, and sound designer. His commercial video work has been broadcast on major TV networks such as CNN and Fox. Aaron is an expert in 3D computer graphics and animation, and has written or co-written three books on the subject. In 1999 he began teaching at the university level, and in 2007 began teaching accelerated professional development courses in Maya and 3ds Max. He currently operates a training website for 3D artists, digitalartsguild.com. Aaron holds a Master of Fine Arts in Film/Video from the California Institute of the Arts, and a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

<h3>Exploratorium New Media Group - <i>Exhibiting Science Interactively</i></h3>
The Exploratorium New Media group develops and collaborates on exhibits that may employ everything from tangible media and embedded computing, to projection and networked systems in a studio atmosphere with a variety of internal and external partners. The goal is to enable first-hand experiences of scientific phenomena--from physics to life sciences and social psychology--that wouldn't be possible without such technologies. The museum and its floor is a unique experimental laboratory for learning of all kinds, with an adjacent shop. This affords developers an opportunity to test and iterate exhibit prototypes with a receptive public audience, beginning at the earliest conceptual stages, in collaboration with scientists and skilled visitor research and evaluation staff.
