<h3>blasthaus and dorkbotSF present <a href=http://www.kontejner.org/>DEVICE ART FORUM</a></h3>
Featuring 10 artists and curators from Croatia, Serbia, Herzegovina, and Slovenia.  Presentations by all and special sneak preview of this exciting exhibition of projects at the intersection of art, science, and technology.  
<p>
Device_art was first initiated by the Croatian independent organization <a href=http://www.kontejner.org/>KONTEJNER</a> | bureau of contemporary art praxis in Zagreb in 2004 in the form of a group exhibition, bringing together artists from Croatia and the region 
(Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro). This year KONTEJNER started to collaborate with Multimedia Institute from Zagreb which is for some years now investigating art and 
skills in that field. American partner <a href=http://blasthaus.com/>blasthaus Gallery</a> from San Francisco is also oriented to technology based art, and the goal of 
this collaboration is to present device art from the region where it is in development most.
<p>
Also, Sergio Vujicic will be making perfumes from peoples' bodily fluids during the event!

<h3>Silvio Vujicic - <i>Perfume 2006</i></h3>
Perfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils and aroma compounds, 
fixatives, and solvents used to give the human body, objects, and 
living spaces a pleasant smell. The amount and type of solvent mix with 
the fragrance oil dictates whether a perfume is considered a perfume 
extract, Eau de parfum, Eau de toilette, or Eau de Cologne.
I'm transforming the upstairs gallery space into a laboratory where, 
using the lab equipment, I'll produce perfumes from human excretions. 
Visitors can 'leave' any of their excretions and the perfume will be 
made from them. They receive one specimen, while the other is retained 
in my perfume repository.
<p>
The time it takes to produce a perfume is ± 60 minutes. The flask 
filling takes place in the gallery. The perfume is named after the 
donor and the type of excretion it was made from. The product can be 
used.
<p>
<b>notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>gallery as laboratory - 'art' becomes functional, both approachable 
and inapproachable - because art might smell badly
<li>sweat, sperm, urine, feces, menstrual blood, milk - as basis for 
perfume derivation, a transformation of excretions into something else 
in an unnatural way
<li>perfume as social and cultural value
<li>invisibility and strange sensuality, a potent substance
<li>flux - importance of flow (. Deleuze)
<li>subjective impression of smell (we like our smell no matter how it 
smells)
</ul>

<h3>Marcell Mars - <i>Multimeida Institute</i></h3>
Multimedia Institute, or [mi2] for short is an NGO established in 1999 
in Zagreb, as a spin-off of the Soros internet program (similar to 
Ljudmila in Slovenia, but a few years later in the process). In 2000 
[mi2] opened its public space, net.culture center "mama"(mama.mi2.hr), 
which instantly became a meeting spot in Zagreb, attracting people with 
its cheap internet access, lounge space with DJs constantly performing, 
presentation and screening space and media-book library. Serving no 
liquor, having no corporate beverage policies, open from 12h to 24h and 
often much later through the night, it has created a unique environment 
for meeting with hackers, philosophers, artists, DJs and activists who 
have time to spare for chilling out in "mama." mi2 is very actively 
involved in the free software revolution.

<h3>curatorial team: Suncica Ostoic, Olga Majcen, Ivana Bago, 
Tomislav Pokrajcic - <i>Kontejner</i></h3>
To be and to act in a critical-investigative manner within reality 
through art, is a sphere of interest for Kontejner / bureau of 
contemporary art practice. Research art practice covers a broad 
artistic sphere in both media and content including intermedia and 
interdisciplinary projects located at the junction of science, 
technology and art, characterized by a hybrid and innovative use of 
media. Content-wise, these projects refer to relevant phenomena of 
contemporary society and culture, dealing with civilizational taboos 
and ethic systems which create them, particularly stressing the field 
of trauma produced by the transgression and violation of norms. This is 
an art concerned with a society of the future, the post-human and his 
obsolete body affected by cybernetics, nonotechnology, biotechnology...

<h3>Sandra Sajovic - <i>Kapelica Gallery</i></h3>
Changing direction in 1995, the gallery now runs a programme that has 
summoned an entirely new audience to the chapel (Kapelica), and to what 
used to be a liturgical place of the Apprentice Hostel. Kapelica 
Gallery is the space of virtual interactions among artists, the 
audience and ideas, and one of the central platforms of contemporary 
art research in Slovenia. It enables people from different artistic 
environments to experiment with new paradigms and borders in 
contemporary art. The gallery programme is based on presentation of art 
production that is scarce or completely absent in other Slovene 
galleries. The points of interest are space installations, 
performances, artistic actions, sound events and artistic presentations 
with educational potential. A common denominator of various genres in 
the gallery is the characteristics of Contemporary Investigative Arts. 
The stress is on research, exploration and experimentation of frontiers 
of artistic discourses and urban poetics. The gallery's programme is 
divided in four main thematic groups: installations and ad hoc 
projects, technology through art, science through art and corporeality 
through art. Kapelica Gallery has established links with numerous 
galleries and initiatives abroad (Live Art Development Agency from UK) 
working with many guest curators, artists and theoreticians of 
contemporary artistic practices. The gallery programme has been 
presented at various symposia and conferences round the world, in the 
framework of numerous international festivals (International Festival 
of Computer Arts (IFCA), Sarajevo Winter, Salon of Young Artists in 
Zagreb) and Biennials (Venice Biennale 2003, International Association 
for the Biennial of Young Artists from Europe and the Mediterranean) 
and the gallery team is also a consulting body for international 
selectors.

<h3>Magdalena Pederin - <i>Supertele 2006</i></h3>
Super-tele deals with the issue of communication. It consists of a 
monitor with a video link with me speaking live with the audience and 
several interactive teddy bears scattered around the room. Each teddy 
bear has its own 'character' and contains a module with a sound 
recording which consists of fragments of typical, everyday 
conversations, activated when the visitor comes closer to it. In a 
separate room a teddy bear is placed with a mobile camera whose motion 
around the room can be followed on the monitor. In the moment when the 
visitor steps onto the marked line in front of the teddy bear, the 
camera focuses on his face and the teddy bear asks three questions: who 
are you, what do you do and what's your phone number. This conversation 
is recorded.

<h3>Ivan Marusic Klif - <i>Undimmed Quivering (via D.B.Indo.) 2006</i></h3>
Preliminary notes for an audio-visual mechanism:
The installation functions as a more or less closed circuit. I set a 
defined group of initial parameters and a set of rules. Once the 
installation is activated, it is impossible to know the exact outcome 
because the system is too chaotic to be predictable. Four overhead 
projectors are placed inside the room. Each contains a pool of water 
which quivers when the system of electric motors and mechanisms is 
activated.
<p>
<ul>Two-way feed-back loop:
<li>sound creates animation
<li>light creates sound image
</ul>
The overhead projection image is created mechanically - electric motors 
and the quivering systems animate the liquid in the pools. The output 
image resolution is unlimited.  Photosensitive sensors react to the changes in light and shade and induce transformations of the synthesized sound. Microphones 
amplify the noise of the electric motors.
