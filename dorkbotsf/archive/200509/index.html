<h3>Dale Dougherty and the Make Crew (Shawn Connally, Kirk Von Rohr, David Pescovitz) - <i>The Making of MAKE</i></h3>
What are you making?  And what do you make of MAKE, the new magazine  
chock-full of DIY technology projects.   MAKE magazine would like to  
know.   Join several members of the Make team as they talk about the  
making of MAKE and its website, makezine.com.     Just six months  
old, MAKE has created quite a lot of buzz while breaking some of the  
rules of magazine publishing.    We'll talk about how MAKE got its  
start, the popularity of magazines like Popular Mechanics of the  
1950s and where we think MAKE can go in the future.   We'd also like  
to discuss your ideas for projects in future issues.
<p>
<b>Dale Dougherty</b> is editor and publisher of MAKE Magazine; he's been with O'Reilly Media for over twenty years.  He'll be joined by Managing Editor, <b>Shawn Connally</b>, Special Projects Editor, <b>David Pescovitz</b>, and Art Director, <b>Kirk Von Rohr</b>.

<h3>Spot Draves - <i>The Latest With Electric Sheep</i></h3>
<p>
Spot will show the latest, as yet unreleased developments of the <a href=http://electricsheep.org/>Electric Sheep</a> project.  Electric Sheep is a free, open source screen saver run by thousands of people all over the world.  When their computers "sleep", the screen saver comes on and the computers communicate with each other by the internet to share the work of creating morphing abstract animations known as "sheep". The result is a collective "android dream", an homage to Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.
<p>
Anyone watching one of these computers may vote for their favorite animations using the keyboard. The more popular sheep live longer and reproduce according to a genetic algorithm with mutation and cross-over. Hence the flock evolves to please its global audience
<P>
<b>Scott Draves a.k.a. Spot</b> is a visualist and programmer residing in San Francisco. He is the creator of the Fractal Flame algorithm, the Bomb visual-musical instrument, and the Electric Sheep distributed screen-saver. All of Draves' software artworks are released as open source and distributed for free on the internet. His award-winning work has appeared in Wired Magazine, the Prix Ars Electronica, the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, and on the dance-floor at the Sonar festival in Barcelona. In 1997 Spot received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University for a thesis on metaprogramming for media processing. Today he regularly projects live video for underground parties and at clubs, and self-publishes SPOTWORKS, a DVD of abstract animation synchronized with electronic music.

<h3>Jon Phillips - <i>How To Build an Online Development Community</i></h3>
<p>
How does one go about utilizing the collective efforts of countless
individuals spread around the world with a minimal amount of energy?
This talk will show how to build an online community that is to
accomplish some goal. Really, this talk should more specifically be
titled, "HOWTO build an Open Source Development Community with under 20
people," however, the principles discussed may be applied to many
different types of online communities. Various applications and
aphorisms of common Free and Open Source software development will be
laced throughout the talk with particular emphasis on non-software based
uses of this evolved strategy for community-building. Examples will be
taken from collaborative development on <a href=http://www.inkscape.org/>Inkscape (www.inkscape.org)</a>, an Open Source Vector drawing tool, and the <a href=http://www.openclipart.org/>Open Clip Art Library (www.openclipart.org)</a>.
<p>
<b>Jon Phillips</b> is an open source developer, artist,
writer, educator, lecturer, and curator with 12+ years of experience
creating communities and working within computing culture. His
involvements with mixing culture and software development have been
shown internationally at San Francisco Art Institute (2005), SFMoMA
(2004), University of Tokyo (2004), Korea Advanced Institute for Science
and Technology (2004), UCLA Hammer Museum's Digital Storytelling
Conference, UC-Berkeley's 040404 Conference (2004), USC Aim Festival IV
(2003), and the ICA London (2002).  He is an open source advocate and
developer on Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org), a scalable vector
graphics editor and on the Open Clip Art Library (http://openclipart.org).  Currently, he is writing/producing a book, "CVS: Concurrency, Versioning and Systems," and produces the "local" journal SCALE.
