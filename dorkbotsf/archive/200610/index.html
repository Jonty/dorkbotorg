<h3>Tim Hunkin - <i>Reinventing the Amusement Space</i></h3>
Tim Hunkin talks about his flourishing UK arcade, full of homemade coin operated games and simulator rides.  <b>Microbreak</b>, the three minute all inclusive package holiday: <b>Mobility Masterclass</b>, train for your future by crossing the freeway with a walker: <b>Test your nerve</b>, how long do you dare put your hand inside the mad dog's cage: and many, many more. He shows how the machines are made, using cannibalised old arcade and gym machines and cheap consumer electronics.  
<p>
Arcades used to be exciting places where you first tried the latest video games. They have a history of technical innovation going back 100 years, when many people's first experience of moving images was Edison's coin operated Kinescope. Arcades today have forgotten their innovative past and are cynically focussing on gambling machines. Its time for a revival!
<p>
Tim Hunkin trained as an engineer, but then became a cartoonist (drawing a strip for a UK sunday paper called <b>The Rudiments of Wisdom</b> for 15 years). His next career was in television (writing and presenting three series called <b>The Secret Life of Machines</b> for Channel 4). For the next ten years he worked for museums, building interactive exhibits and curating and designing exhibitions. He is currently obsessed with his amusement arcade on Southwold pier.

<h3>Mike Kuniavsky - <i>The Coming Age of Magic</i></h3>
Increasingly, the devices in our lives have behaviors that we do not, and 
cannot, fully control, based on technologies that are difficult to 
understand. This situation can be frustrating. For us nerds, these 
frustrations may drive our desire to hack technology or they may create a 
nostalgia for technologies whose power is easier to understand (or at 
least touch). However, many people have to live with this tech and make it 
do what it's supposed to (or at least what we expect of it), but few will 
have the time to delve into how it works.
<p>
How can we explain the functionality of new technologies in a useful way 
when their actual functionality is highly complex and interrelated?
<p>
The desktop metaphor was useful for twenty years as a way to structure and 
explain information-processing technology. I propose using "magic" as a 
replacement metaphor when creating technology, instead of the desktop 
metaphor. Not pretending that technology is magic so as to avoid 
explaining how it works, but as a framework for communicating how devices 
work and interact with each other and with us.
<p>
Mike Kuniavsky is a consultant, designer, author, and researcher focused on the experience of technology and how it affects design and business.  He graduated from the University of Michigan with a dual degree in Computer Science and Film/Video Studies.  In 2003 he wrote <b>Observing the User Experience</b> and is currently working on a book of case studies of user experience design for mobile and ubiquitous computing due in 2007 from Elsevier.
