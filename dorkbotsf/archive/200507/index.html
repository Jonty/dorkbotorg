<br><br>
TradeMark G. / Mark Gunderson is an audio artist, culture jammer, equipment designer, and organizer. He is best known for founding The Evolution Control Committee in 1986, a band renowned for its copyright-challenging stance. This resulted in the CBS television network threatening suit for sampling newscaster Dan Rather, but also gave The ECC credit for creating the 'mash-up' genre of music.  TradeMark G. is also the creator of The ECC's Thimbletron, a live sampling performance instrument, and has been behind all of The ECC's 16 full-length albums, a videotape, 2 seven-inch records, and even an 8-track tape and a wax cylinder recording. TradeMark G. and The ECC have given over 500 live performances at festivals, concert halls, bars, and galleries in Australia, Germany, Holland, England, France, New York, San Francisco, and elsewhere.

<h3>monochrom - <i>Experience the Experience of 1 Baud</i></h3>
The International Code of Signals serves to facilitate communication at sea. It defines the meaning of alphabetical identification codes for safety and navigation purposes. The key for "sending" was drafted by a committee of the British Board of Trade in 1855 and published in 1857. The 1969 edition, revised in 2003, is still in use today. We have expanded the flag alphabet, not just so that it also includes the @ sign, but so that city dwellers have access to pure communication. The flag alphabet will be taught in a workshop lasting several hours. After a few days set aside for study and practice, we would like, in the form of a competition, to send an identical message across the city over two equally long routes simultaneously. Will it work?
<p>
monochrom is an art-technology-philosophy group of basket weaving enthusiasts and theory do-it-yourselfers having its seat in Vienna and Zeta Draconis. monochrom is the super-affirmation of the globalization trap. monochrom has existed in this (and every other) form since 1993.

<br>Workshop: July 20, 7:30 PM.
<br>Event: July 22, 5 PM.
