<h3>Balint Seeber and John Malsbury - <i>The ISEE-3 Reboot Project - First Contact from Arecibo</i></h3>
Description: The ISEE-3 space probe  (renamed the International Cometary
Explorer) was launched in 1978 to study the solar wind's interaction with
the Earth's magnetic field. NASA abandoned the ISEE-3 after the probe
completed its science mission, and funding dried up. Its systems were
shutdown, but the transponders were left on. In 2008, as it continued on its
planned trajectory back toward Earth, its carriers were detected. Then, just
over a month ago, a private group of space folk decided to crowd-fund-raise
the ISEE-3 Reboot Mission. The main aim is to establish contact with the
space craft, assess its health, command a series of manoeuvres to change its
trajectory to put it into a large orbit around the Earth, and allow open
access for continuing public science. I joined the Away Team at the Arecibo
Radio Observatory to help them on the radio-side of the affair, so we could
send commands to the probe ~10 million miles away, and record telemetry
after we successfully turned it back on, all using Software Defined Radio,
open source GNU Radio and the largest radio telescope on the planet.
<p>
A software engineer by training, Balint is a perpetual hacker,
Applications Specialist and SDR Evangelist at Ettus Research, and the guy
behind spench.net. His passion is extracting interesting information from
lesser-known data sources and visualizing them in novel ways. Lately, he has
 become obsessed with Software Defined Radio and all that can be decoded from
the ether. When not receiving electromagnetic radiation, he likes to develop
 interactive web apps for presenting spatial data. Originally from Australia,
he moved to the United States in 2012 to pursue his love of SDR.

<h3>Dan Novy - <i></i></h3>
NovySan will discuss his past work at the MIT Media Lab, "Science Fiction to Science Fabrication" and its future sister course "Indistinguishable From," as well as the upcoming Festival Technologies class, and new directions in Non-Invasive Narrative Neurostimulation
<p>
Dan Novy (a.k.a NovySan) is a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab, where he works to
decrease the alienation fostered by traditional passive media consumption; increase social
interaction through transparent, interconnected and fluid media; and create an enriched, active,
and inspired immediate experience. He is an Emmy and Visual Effects Society Award-winning
VFX Technical Supervisor, Transmedia Experience Designer, and Artist. At the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he received a BFA in Theatre and an MA in Theatre History, with a
double emphasis in the technical history of the theatre and shamanic ritual performance in pre-agrarian
societies. He is the former Chair of the Visual Effects Society's Technology Committee
and Co-Instructor of the Media Lab's Science Fiction to Science Fabrication class.

<h3>Ben de Leeuw - <i>Camera Sculptura</i></h3>
The Camera Sculptura is a massive photo-array 3D scanner. Using 68 camera nodes, with a gigapixel of resolution, photos are simultaneously taken from all directions. These photos become the data for a 3D reconstruction of the subject. The Camera Sculptura was specifically designed and built to do scans of people (and maybe animals.) 
The scanner was built with mostly off the shelf, low cost components. The cameras operate using CHDK, the Canon Hack Developers Kit. This allows the simultaneous triggering, as well as many photo controls that make using sub $100 point and shoot cameras possible.
<p>
Ben de Leeuw is a twenty plus year veteran of the 3D graphics industry. Unable to contain his mad scientist impulses, he created the Camera Sculptura as a way to bring the real world into the computer. 
<p>
Tara Packard is veteran maker  who has worked professionally as an animator and is the creator of a drivable rubber duck.

<h3>Daniel Anderson - <i>Interactive Projection Mapping with VDMX & Quartz Composer</i></h3>
VDMX is a VJ application for Macintosh that delivers industrial-strength visuals. Quartz Composer is an awesome graphical programming tool. Best of all, these two tools work together. In this brief demo we'll explore how to create custom VDMX plugins in Quartz Composer to let you program and control your projection-mapped visual sets with WiiMotes or other OSC-capable motion devices. Manipulate data real time to create interactive tools that extend the possibilities of your visual sets. We may additionally explore creating "tracer" sprites for projection mapping with Photoshop & MadMapper.
<p>
Daniel Anderson (blondknaut/knautwerk) is an interactive installation and VJ/live visual artist who uses projection mapping and realtime graphics to create immersive and stunning visual experiences. A web developer by trade with a background in visual and performing arts, Daniel pushes the boundaries of his visual sets with original graphics and real-time interaction. Check out his work at http://blond.knaut.net & Facebook.com/knautwork & @knautwerk on Twitter.
