</p><h3>Mark Pesce - <i>The Hacking Light</i></h3>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
The Light by MooresCloud is a beautiful, intelligent, connected Light built on open-hardware & open-software platforms currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter <a href=http://moorescloud.com/kickstarter/>(moorescloud.com/kickstarter)</a>.  52 full-color LEDs controlled by an embedded computer running Linux and connected to your tablet, smartphone and the Internet via WiFi. This 'lamp with a LAMP stack' takes the Internet of Things in a new direction: these connected Lights provide 'Illumination-as-a-service", so you can take a photo of a flower and set the Light to match its color, or synchronize streaming media with a light show. An on-board accelerometer allows you to enjoy games and literally hack with light.
<p>
Mark Pesce is best known as the co-inventor of VRML, which brought the third dimension to the World Wide Web. The author of six books, Pesce founded post-graduate programs in interactive media at both the University of Southern California and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, and for seven years served as panelist and judge on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's hit series "The New Inventors".  The Light by MooresCloud is his latest invention.

The Moxie Institute then makes free customized versions for non profits all over the world. 
<p>
Three of these short films have now been released from the series "Let it Ripple: Mobile Films for Global Change." The films include music by Moby, Supertramp and Polyphonic Spree and they have made customized versions for 300 non-profits in the last year.  Tiffany will share these films and the experiments in making them.
<p>
Honored by Newsweek as one of the "Women Shaping the 21st Century", Tiffany Shlain is a filmmaker and founder of The Webby Awards. Her films and work have received over 50 awards including a Disruptive Innovation Award from the Tribeca Film Festival.

<h3>Ken Goldberg - <i>Bloom: Aesthetics and Analysis of Streaming Seismic Data</i></h3>
Ken has developed several projects that use a live feed of seismic data from the UC Berkeley Seismology Lab.  One example is Ballet Mori, a performance to commemorate the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, where SF Ballet Principal Dancer Muriel Maffre responded to a musical composition modulated by real-time seismic data.
<p>
His latest project, Bloom, will open at the Nevada Museum of Art in mid-February.  Colors are extracted from photographs of flowers found on Flickr.  The size and position of each bloom is based on real-time changes in the Earth's motion, measured as a vertical velocity continuously updated from the seismometer.  The horizontal position of blooms is based on time, their vertical position is based on magnitude of the second derivative, and their size is based on the time between extrema.
<p>
Ken Goldberg is Prof. of Engineering and Craigslist Distinguished
Professor of New Media at UC Berkeley.  His artwork has been exhibited
at Ars Electronica, ZKM, Centre Pompidou, ICC Biennale, Kwangju
Biennale, Artists Space, The Kitchen, and the Whitney Biennial.<p>
