<h3>Eric Paulos - <i>Interactive City</i></h3>
As our megalopolis expands, fragments, and warps, we look towards
governments, industry, world leaders, and pop stars to guide the way.
The party rhetoric echoes a future vision filled with beautiful,
delicious urban technologies that will sooth the souls of our
communities, generate playful neo-geo-landscapes, and celebrate our
omni-connected harmony? But what do we truly aspire, desire, and
admire? Emerge from the labs, galleries, homes, offices, and suburbs.
Break free and engage in the first open forum Interactive City Summit
to be held 7-8 Aug in San Francisco. The talk will feature a quick
highlight of some recent projects by Urban Atmospheres with an
emphasis on the upcoming ruckus to occur on the streets of San
Francisco and San Jose around ISEA2006 and the Interactive City Summit.
