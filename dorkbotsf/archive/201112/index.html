</p><h3>Jeremy Franklin-Ross and Mike McCracken - <i>Smash Putt: Miniature Golf Apocalypse</i></h3>
Smash Putt "Miniature Golf Apocalypse" is an artist made miniature golf course... with an eclectic fully stocked bar. Players putt through a gauntlet of devious mechanized obstacles, many of which attempt to destroy golfballs. Brash, noisy, and playful.
<br>
A few notable holes include:
<br>"Scatch n' Sniff", a test of luck, skill, and olfactory prowess.
<br>"Driving Range", featuring 3 high velocity golfball cannons.
<br>"Moving Terrain", walls and ramps slam up and down making a new combination of obstacles by the press of a button.
<p>
Jeremy and Mike will discuss technology utilized in Smash Putt with focus on pragmatic nuances of pneumatics. They will then get drunk and talk about "... you know, art n shit."
<p>
Jeremy Franklin-Ross is an artist and technologist. His project domains have included novel instruments, flame devices, software development, radio control of automobiles, and oddball robotics. In 2008, Jeremy founded the Smash Putt project, an artist made mechanized miniature golf course. He enjoys designing and fabricating playful mechanized doodads.
<p>
Mike McCracken has been making music since his youth and software almost as long. Since 2007, he has been exploring electronics as an artistic medium creating several installations using electronics and software. Projects include: sound environment where participants are represented by recombinant sounds of their own contribution (Audible Avatar), a box that pneumatically locks your hand in until someone frees you (becoming trapped themselves), a wall of growths that writhes in agitation as you get near (set from Manifold Motion's Under). Also, Mike is a bad-ass drummer in Titanium Sporkestra.

<h3>Sasha Harris-Cronin - <i>MSI Giant Heart</i></h3>
BBI Engineering worked with Thinc Design and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to help create a 15' tall x 8' wide interactive sculptural beating heart for You! The Experience.  This exhibit replaced a walk-through heart that had been in the museum for generations, so perforce had to be stunning.
<p>
In addition to the heart itself, the exhibit has two kiosks.  When a visitor holds the heart rate sensors on one kiosk, the heart will beat in time with their heartbeat. A visitor on the other kiosk can choose to see different outside and inside views of the heart. Five blended and warped projectors create the outside front view. Two projectors create the internal cutaway of the heart.  
<p>
Sasha will discuss the development and technology behind the exhibit, which was challenging in the extreme.
<p>
Sasha Harris-Cronin is the lead creative programmer at BBI Engineering in San Francisco.  She has spent the last decade working with museums and exhibit designers to create exhibits and experiences primarily in the realm of physical computing and new technologies.  These are exhibits that are pushed and pulled, picked up or waved at, or that use a visitor's heart rate or record a personal video.  She works as everything from programmer to designer to project manager to media producer and technology designer.
<p>
In the last year, she has done projects with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Visitor Center in Seattle, the Discovery Science Center in Anaheim, the Sunnylands Visitor Center in Palm Springs, and with the Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta.

<h3>Tim Thompson - <i>Space Palette: A New Instrument Using the Kinect</i></h3>
The Microsoft Kinect is a major advance in the accessibility and affordability of 3D input sensors.  Tim will discuss the use of the Kinect in creating a musical and graphical instrument called the Space Palette.
<P>
Tim Thompson is a software engineer, musician, and installation artist.  His wide-ranging artistic work includes a programming language for MIDI (KeyKit), interactive installations at Burning Man (a 12-foot-high lyre, an 11-foot high monolith, and an antique radio), musical performances with Playstation dance pads and QWERTY keyboards, graphical performances using multitouch pads (pre-iPhone), and realtime video looping and processing with a handheld security camera (LoopyCam).  His most recent work uses the Microsoft Kinect to create a musical and graphical instrument called the Space Palette.

<h3>Matt Goodman - <i>Playa Time Lapse Project</i></h3>
The Playa Time Lapse Project captured a bird's eye view of 27 days of Burning Man: set up, break down, and lots of burning, all into a five minute video.  They have a <a href=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattyg/263108053>Kickstarter</a> to fund a bigger, better Time Lapse 2.0 for 2012 Burning Man.
<p>
Matthew Goodman is the lead software architect at a biotech startup in San Francisco which builds specialized microscopy equipment.  These robotic zombies (microscopes) consume the brains of small animals and creates digital representations of their structure.
<p>
Matthew, as many avid burner nerds do, has participated in big art in both the main burn as well as regional events.  Matthew's other projects have included machine learning research, large scale fluid-dynamics simulations, and high-power rocketry.
