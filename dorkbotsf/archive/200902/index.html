<h3>Mitch Altman - <i>TV-B-Gone: From Thought to (Bizarre and Cool) Reality</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>
Like all projects, TV-B-Gone universal
remote control started off as a thought.  More of a fantasy,
really.  Yet one that Mitch somehow knew he could follow through on.  In
this talk Mitch will show how the notion of turning off TVs in public
places ended up taking over his life, providing he and his friends a
living, and creating a new meme around the world.  Along the way
he points out some of hows and whys, as well as some of the more
interesting and stressful aspects of the process.  Mitch hopes to show
why taking risks can be way worthwhile.
<p>
Though most known for inventing the wildly
popular TV-B-Gone, a keychain that makes it fun to turn off TVs in
public places, Mitch Altman is an inventor with a reputation for
creating intriguing devices that amaze and delight, such as the
Brain Machine, Trippy RGB Waves, and the Mignonette Game.  Mitch
co-founded 3ware (a Silicon Valley RAID controller company), and
co-founded Noisebridge (a San Francisco hacker space).  Mitch has
written for MAKE Magazine and 2600 Journal, and for the last few
years has traveled the world teaching people to solder and how to
make cool things with microcontrollers.  He is currently writing a
book to teach total beginners how to make cool things with
microcontrollers.
