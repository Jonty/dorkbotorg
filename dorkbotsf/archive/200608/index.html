<font size=2>Note our new venue, which is a live/work space. In order not to 
inconvenience the residents, we will be more proactive about both starting 
on time (7:30!) and keeping on schedule (30 min per speaker). The Encounter Studio is a little smaller than our usual places.  Bringing your own seat might not be a bad idea, as we may run out. There is very limited parking on site, so please try street parking. As usual, please arrive on time or earlier for the best seating, and donations to our hosts are always appreciated.</font>

<h3>Simran Gleason - <i>Generative Music</i></h3>
Generative Music, since coming into the public eye with Brian Eno's 
1970's ambient work, has lately been gaining more attention for creating 
video game background music that better fits the game's mood. It's also 
very useful for creating ever-changing soundscapes for interactive art 
installations.
<p>
Simran Gleason will speak about, and perform, several of his recent
reactive and generative music algorithms, including Haunted Garden, a
room that listens and creates an ambient soundscape harmonically derived
from what it hears. Simran recently taught it to play piano, and will
accompany it in a short duet. Also on the menu are Life Music, an 
algorithm that generates music from Conway's game of Life that inadvertently turned into an automatic horror movie soundtrack generator, as well as DNA Notes, which melodifies DNA data, and Alea, a random composition generator inspired
by Brian Eno's "Music for Airports." If time permits, Simran will talk
about some of the issues involved in composing for randomness.
<p>
Simran Gleason is a composer, musician, programmer, and cetera. He likes 
to build instruments -- physical and software -- and play them in 
strange ensembles such as Mixtape from Mars or the Killing My Lobster 
Science Band. He does sound design for film and theater and creates 
sound sculpture installations in the occasional dusty place. Lately he 
has been concentrating on generative music that takes input from its 
surroundings to create soundscapes. Oh yeah, he's also a professional 
nerd by day at Collabnet.

<h3>Steve Omohundro - <i>The Consequences of Very Smart Machines</i></h3>
Dr. Stephen Omohundro comes to us with an impressive resume. Among other
things, he was a scientist at Thinking Machines, architected the Sather 
programming language, and wrote the 3D graphics portion of Wolfram's 
Mathematica. Recently Steve has been working on systems that program 
themselves as a vehicle to machine intelligence. Along the way, he has 
been thinking deeply and originally about the consequences of machines 
that are self-aware and self-improving. He'll talk about the psychology 
of these systems, how to prevent machine psychopaths, and how to create 
a healthy AI ecology in which human values and wisdom flourish. This 
promises to be a thought-provoking and exciting discussion.
