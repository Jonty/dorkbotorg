<b>Tim Thompson</b> - <i>Key Kit: Happy Feet, Joy Balls, and other Tune Toys</i>
<br>
Wireless joysticks, playstation dance pads, and webcams are the devices that Tim Thompson has been using lately to control his algorithmic music toys - all developed using KeyKit, a freely-available programming language designed for realtime MIDI experimentation.  A multi-window GUI with pull-off menus and buttons was written using the language itself, making it uniquely extensible.  This talk will demonstrate KeyKit using Tim's recent explorations and musical toys. 
<p>
Tim Thompson is a software developer and musician who has been developing and using KeyKit for more than 17 years.  His website has a variety of interactive web-based music toys which use KeyKit for their processing.

<b>Dan Bornstein</b> - <i>A Little Bit About The Hiptop</i>
<br>
Danger makes a mobile communications platform known as the "hiptop" 
which is currently incarnated as the Sidekick, a handheld device that 
is both a cellphone and internet appliance. 
<p>
Dan Bornstein works on the software that runs inside the device, and he'll describe the system in general and talk about the programming model and relatively new developer program, and he will be happy to at least take a stab at answering questions you might have about the device.

<b>Dr. Aaron Wolf Baum aka Dr. Friendly</b>
<br>
Doctor Friendly will present a rocket-powered overview of complexity and artificial life and how they relate to love and art.  This segue into a performance with intelligent live self-generating graphics and sound, followed by unstructured organism-audience interaction.
<p>
In 1981 the twelve-year old future Dr. Aaron Wolf Baum, now Dr. Friendly, read astronomy textbooks, programmed TRS-80s, wrote poetry, and wandered in the woods.Next came a career in physics, culminating in a Ph.D. from Stanford and a job in Silicon Valley commercializing a technology he had pioneered.  His artistic vision was first realized in the  Nebulous Entity which irradiated the 1999 Burning Man festival.  Since March 2000  he has worked  exclusively on programmed sensory environment-instruments and science fiction myth-making.
