<h3>Greg Hazel - <i>Incoherence: Stereo Field Spectrum Analysis</i></h3>
Incoherence displays stereo field and frequency information
together, in real-time. It can show frequency-dependant phase
information in an intuitive way. The demo will include an introduction
to the display layout, basic functions and music demonstrations.
<p>
Greg and Steven Hazel started OMG Audio in 2004 to develop an application for
visualizing the stereo field in an intuitive way. Greg was attending
school for audio production at the time, and came up with the idea based on
explanantions of stereo mixing.  Steve pitched in with his knowledge of FFTs,
and they wrote the first version of Incoherence in their free time over the course of the next several months.

<h3>Matt Chisholm and Ross Cohen - <i>The Neighborhood Project</i></h3>
The Neighborhood Project is creating a map of city neighborhoods based on the collective opinions of internet users. Addresses and neighborhood data are
translated into latitude and longitude values, and then drawn on a map. The address and neighborhood data are collected from housing posts on Craigslist,
and from people filling out a form on the web. It is an experiment in collective knowledge. The more people who add their opinion to the database, the
more accurate the neighborhood boundaries become.
<p>
Matt Chisholm has degrees in Mathematics and Linguistics from UC Santa Cruz, has worked for BitTorrent, and is a co-founder of Mosuki.com.  He's created
other generative art projects such as Alphabet Soup and the DeX playing card generator. Ross Cohen has degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from
Carnegie Mellon, was CTO at BitTorrent, and currently works for Mosuki.com.  He also is the author of the next-generation, distributed version control
system Codeville.
