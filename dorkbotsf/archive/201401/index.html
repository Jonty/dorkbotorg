<h3>Rudy Rucker (the Elder) - <i>The Big Aha Quantum High</i></h3>
Rudy will show some slides of his paintings, discuss an idea from his latest novel, The Big Aha, and read a short passage about this idea.  The Big Aha is a comic whirlwind of enlightenment, aliens, and telepathy---bringing back the psychedelic era with a quantum-consciousness high.  The high involves noticing that your awareness oscillates between a cosmic focus and a calculating assessment of the people and things around you.  In The Big Aha, the characters find a way to jam the switch open and stay in the cosmic mode. Telepathy ensues.
<p>
Rudy Rucker is a writer, a mathematician, a painter, and a computer science professor.  He received Philip K. Dick awards for his cyberpunk novels Software and Wetware.  Recent works include his autobiography, Nested Scrolls, a book of his art, Better Worlds, and his SF novel, The Big Aha. A show of his paintings runs at Borderlands Books through March 15, with an opening party on Friday, Jan 17.  More info via Rudy's home page (link below).

<h3>Shovelman</h3>
Shovelman is a junkyard beatnik, a shovel guitar wielding surrealist folk superhero. Armed with a collection of pawnshop effects pedals and an old barn-shovel turned slide-guitar, Shovelman plays ol' fashioned folktronica-grooves looped straight out of the ground. The sounds of Mississippi delta blues from the electro-psychedelic future, collide with the antiquated rubble of lyrical one-man-band hoboetry. Shovelman has become infamous in San Francisco where he currently resides as well as on the west coast festival circuit, opening for bands that include Primus, Beats Antique, Sean Hayes, Jason Webly and Reggie Watts
<p>
"Shovelman has forged a perfect merger of the past and the present with his bluesy 'folktronic' sound." - LA Weekly
<p>
"Shovelman's music would be playing on the radio if Tom Waits and Les Claypool ever went on a road trip together ......and were lost." - Chip, 'So Wat TV

<h3>Jake - <i>Making a DIY Robotic Assembly System from a 3D Printer</i></h3>
Jake needed to mount tiny solar cells onto slabs of copper, and then solder tiny wires to them somehow, and do this dozens or hundreds of times.  He figured only a robot could do such precise and tedious work, and so he made one from a Type A Machine prototype, an air compressor, vacuum pump, soldering irons, steppers, servos, and computer vision.
<p> 
Jake has been hacking since he plugged a key into an outlet from his crib. He's made radio transmitters and audio amplifiers, many blinkin lights, played with microcontrollers and computers and also used them for work, made a brain-controlled robot out of an electric wheelchair.  Now he's working with a company making a new kind of solar panel, manufacturing their product in a way that's new for he and the american DIY movement as far as he knows.<p>

<h3>Paul Freedman - <i>The Bike Powered Concert</i></h3>
Concerts are an ideal and inspiring Pedal Power activity. You start with the fun group dynamics of a multi-bike pedal power system, in which any number of people work together to create a stable distributed DC power supply. Then you add the element of music, which has the potential to create emotional transformations. The bike powered concert combines the feeling of empowerment, independence, and fun of bike power, with the emotional power of music. With an efficient PA (set of loudspeakers) and Pedal Power system, 100-200 audience members can enjoy festival-grade for every 1 pedaler contributing power. Concert goers can better connect with their favorite bands by powering their show. From diesel and coal to burrito power, pedal powered concerts have the potential to focus the inspiring energy of Pedal Power on a particular message: love, taking care of the planet, equality, or just plain funk.
<p>
Paul Freedman, a.k.a. Fossil Fool, the Bike Rapper, has produced over 200 bike powered music performances, ranging from street parties and school visits to all-day music festival stages. He founded Rock The Bike in 2003 and began experimenting with Pedal Power in 2006. He is the creator of El Arbol, the Bike Tree, a.k.a. the Funky Quadricycle, and the tallest bike in the Bay Area.
