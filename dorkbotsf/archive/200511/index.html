<!--<h3>Trevor Smith - <i>Making the Memex</i></h3>
The future sucks.  Fix the past.  It is an embarrassment to
electricity and celluloid that nobody bothered to instantiate one of
the most influential designs of information technology.  The memex
was described in 1945 as an electromechanical tool for scholars to
share hypertexts in the form of microfilm "trails" of interlinking
documents.  The publication describing the memex is credited with
popularizing the original ideas of the web and lighting a fire under
the geeks who fabricated the net.  Trevor will present the details of this
influential paperware and his plan to bring it out of vaporware.
<p>
Trevor F. Smith prototypes geegaws for the eggheads at [Xerox] PARC.
He enjoys para-snorkeling, beer with funny labels, and the occasional
explosion.

<h3>Graham Plumb - <i>Light Fantastic</i></h3>
This presentation will begin with an acrylic cube filled with water and light,
reactive to sound, gesture and the breath of someone from the
audience. We will then move on to bags of water filled with
electricity, a map of the world made from sun burnt skin peeled from
the artists backside, walls built from reactive bricks of light and a
Museum in Hawaii containing a three story volcano designed to erupt
over Oahu at the push of a button.
<p>
Graham promises a varied line up of projects, diverse in their intent
and origins but connected by a fascination with the wonderful
phenomenon of light. He will demonstrate how light can be transformed
into an object, used to dissolve walls into windows, or be diffused
just enough to support uncertain scientific theories.
<p>
Graham is a media artist and museum exhibit designer originally from
the UK and now living in San Francisco. He designs physically
interactive experiences for museums and galleries. His talk will
present a selection of work completed in the past 10 years  - from
free flowing experimental personal research projects to carefully
planned visitor experiences for Museums throughout Europe and North
America. This will include a premiere of the most recent project to
date - the new 'Science Learning Center' for the Bishop Museum in
Hawaii.

<h3>Tom Zimmerman - <i>Using Electronics Gadgets to Teach Kids Science and Engineering
</i></h3>
For the past several years Tom has been visiting K-12 students in public schools
developing technology and after-school classes to help kids discover and
explore science and engineering, often using music and visual arts to attract
students' interest. The technology he will discuss includes programming
robots with playing cards, hacking digital cameras to make animated movies and
lensless microscopes, electronic circuits to sequence LEDs and perform strobe
experiments, building musical instruments, and using inexpensive components to
do science fair projects.
<p>
Thomas G. Zimmerman is a member of the research staff exploring the frontiers of human-computer interaction at the IBM Almaden Research Center. His 15
patents cover position tracking, pen input, wireless communication, music training, biometrics and encryption. Mr. Zimmerman's inventions include the
Data Glove, Electric Field Personal Area Network (EF PAN), a wireless PDA to capture multiple biometrics, and tokenless electronic tender secured with
dynamic signature verification. His interactive exhibits are installed at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, National Geographic Society in Washington, DC,
and Great Lakes Science Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. He received his B.S. in Humanities and Engineering (1980) and M.S. in Media Science (1995) from MIT.
