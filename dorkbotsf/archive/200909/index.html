<h3>Mark Pauline - <i>Survival Research Labs</i></h3>
Mark will talk about what ever the hell he feels like.  Probably the robot-building business, large scale machine performances and 30 years of intriguing machine prank/art anecdotes...
<p>
Mark Pauline (born December 14, 1953) is an American performance artist and inventor, best known as founder and director of Survival Research Labs.  Pauline founded SRL in 1978 and it is considered the premier practitioner of "industrial performing arts", and the forerunner of large scale machine performance. SRL is known for producing the most dangerous shows on earth. Although acknowledged as a major influence on popular competitions pitting remote-controlled robots and machines against each other, such as BattleBots and Robot Wars, Pauline shies away from rules-bound competition preferring a more anarchic approach. Machines are liberated and re-configured away from the functions they were originally meant to perform.
<p>
Pauline has written of SRL, "Since its inception SRL has operated as an organization of creative technicians dedicated to re-directing the techniques, tools, and tenets of industry, science, and the military away from their typical manifestations in practicality, product or warfare." Since its beginning through the end of 2006, SRL has conducted about 48 shows.
<p>
In August 1990, ArtPark, a state-sponsored arts festival in Lewiston, New York, cancelled a Pauline performance when it turned out he intended "to cover a sputtering Rube Goldberg spaceship with numerous Bibles" that would "serve as thermal protective shields" and be burned to ashes in the course of the performance.[1]
<p>
According to Pauline "I like to make machines that can just do their own shows... machines that can do all that machines in the science fiction novels can do. I want to be there to make those dreams real."[2]

<h3>Michael Ang - <i>Light, Attraction and Emotion: Projects with Photons, Biology and Electrons</i></h3>
Inverse Parasol is an illuminated parasol that becomes a portable
space for personal interaction on dark nights. Strange Attractor seeks
the intersection of human and insect aesthetics as an intended object
of desire for both humans and butterflies. Mang's recent work with the
GigaPan robotic camera system explores how the tool can be used to
capture story, emotion, and discrete moments of time. Together these
projects represent the use of technology to explore and interact with
the physical, biological, and social world around us.
<p>
Michael Ang (http://www.michaelang.com) is an artistic, hacker and
engineer working at the intersection of art, technology and human
experience. He is a graduate of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications
Program (ITP) and currently works at the Internet Archive in support
of its goal of Universal Access to All Knowledge.
