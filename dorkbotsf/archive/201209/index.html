</p><h3>Brad Templeton - <i>Robot Cars Will Change the World Far More Than You Think</i></h3>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=2 valign=top>
Thanks to DARPA-sponsored contests and new work at Google, robot cars
are no longer science fiction; they're coming within a decade. Their
implications are quite remarkable -- and not just for transportation,
where they can offer a mere saving of millions of lives, billions of
hours and trillions of dollars. Robocars can change how we live and
work, change our cities, change manufacturing, housing. Crucially in
today's world, they also have the potential to make serious inroads on
our energy and emissions problems. The talk will discuss the merits and
downsides of robocars, potential paths to get there, roadblocks along
the way and what the world of robocars will be like. 
<p>
Brad Templeton
founded and ran <a href=http://www.clari.net/>ClariNet Communications Corp.</a>, the first internet-based

<h3>Moldover - <i>Moldover's new controller: The RoboCaster</i></h3>
Hi!  I'm Moldover.  I'm leaving SF for my US fall tour on Sept 22.  I'm excited that Karen has given me a chance to demonstrate one of the instruments I'll be performing with at Dorkbot.  It's a MIDI controller built into a guitar that I call The RoboCaster.  I have a whole bunch of new original music that I perform with the RoboCaster and my other custom-made electronic instruments.  I look forward to explaining how I design my instruments and sharing my new songs with you!
<p>
If technology and music are your life, brace yourself- <a href=http://moldover.com/>MOLDOVER</a> is about to reformat your soul. Hailed by over 1,000,000 YouTube viewers as "The Godfather of Controllerism", Moldover is a new breed of music icon. Combining the charisma of a rock star, the mad genius of a basement inventor, and the radical inclusiveness of the DIY internet generation, Moldover is "literally throwing away the rule book and reinventing the wheel" (Remix Magazine). Witness his balls-to-the-wall <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UXG4SWCzGI>LIVE SHOW</a> at a club, experience one of his <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muj-1m2X-4M>JAMBOX</a> multiplayer instruments at a festival, or pick up and play the <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8UzSVFUIc0&feature=related>"LIGHT THEREMIN"</a> packaging of his debut album and understand why the next paradigm for music is a one-man-brand called Moldover.<p>

<h3>Balint Seeber - <i>All your RFz Are Belong to Me: Hacking the Wireless World with Software Defined Radio</i></h3>
<p>
Ever wondered what traffic is flowing through the many satellites in orbit above you?  Ever wanted to intercept RADAR signals from air traffic control and visualise your airspace in real-time on a 3D map? While you're at it, check how many faults have been reported by the next plane you'll be travelling on (e.g. do the toilets work?). If you have ever wanted to reverse engineer a wireless system, this is for you!
<p>
A software engineer by training, Balint is the perpetual hacker and guy behind <a href=http://spench.net/>spench.net</a>. His passion is extracting interesting information from often lesser-known data sources, and visualising them in novel ways. Lately, he has become obsessed with Software Defined Radio and all that can be decoded from the ether.
