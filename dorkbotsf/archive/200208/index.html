<b>Rudy Rucker</b> - <i>Home-made Wireless Antennae</i>

it all about?  Rudy will explain the technology and show some home made
antennae.  Learn how you can use wireless!

<b>Mad Max</b> - <i>The Obnoxicator</i>
<br>
Inspired by Ed the Clown, an Obnoxicator is a modified Radio Shack BullHorn.  
Its elegance is in its simplicity.  Its power and ability to annoy is in its 
volume.  After its first hour of usage, it became clear that it can also be a wonderful musical
instrument.  I will endeavor to explain the construction, and care & feeding
of an Obnoxicator.  I will also give a demonstration of its capabilites.
<br>
As a child, Mad Max built strange machines, remote controlled gadgets, and things
that exploded; some of which actually worked.  As an adult artist and
engineer, he builds strange machines,  remote controlled gadgets, and things
that boom; most of which, frequently work.  Nothing has really changed all
that much, except now, he has a bigger tool box.

<b>Kimric Smythe</b> - <i>Fire Spewing Vacuum Cleaners</i>
<br>
Kimric Smythe was half of the team that did the pyro for 
Burning Man for 10 yrs.  He did some experiments for a web 
site that wanted some crazy stuff including propane fueled 
vacuum cleaners, rocket powered inflate a dates and exploding 
doll houses. Other stunts Kimric has been involved in are the
<a href=http://peoplehater.org/carhunthtml/carframe.html>Car Hunt</a>, 
The Amorphous Blob,  The Orca Bomb, Return of the Fat Man ,
<a href=http://weirdtv.com/>Weird TV</a>, and The Drive-By Shooting
Range.
 Some other more practical projects are; the machine mounted camera for SRL
shows that produced really nice footage, a livelihood repairing and selling
accordions <b>Smythe's Accordion Center</b> and his improbable taste in cars.
<p>
This month Kimric is starting a project on his idea
called "Things that might fly if you put enough rockets on them" 
for Evening Magazine.  He is hoping to test a RC hot air blimp with a 
20lb payload at the SRL show this fall.
