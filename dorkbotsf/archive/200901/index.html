<h3>Joe Grand - <i>The Projects of Prototype This</i></h3>
Designing and building projects is hard. Designing and building  
projects of things that have never been done before is harder.  
Designing and building projects of things that have never been done  
before with the financial and time constraints of television is  
verging on ridiculous.
<p>
For 18 months, I was a co-host of Prototype This on Discovery Channel,  
an engineering entertainment program that followed the real-life  
design process of a unique prototype every episode. Comprised of an  
electrical engineer (that's me), a roboticist, a material scientist,  
and special effects guy, we had the major bases covered and would  
often join forces with outside resources. We filmed thirteen episodes  
in very challenging conditions and that single season has almost  
finished airing.
<p>
In this mostly visual presentation, I'll go through design details and  
show never-before-seen pictures and videos related to some of my  
favorite episodes, including the Traffic-Busting Truck, Fire Fighter  
PyroPack, and Virtual Sea Adventure, each of which had to be designed  
and built in a matter of weeks.
<P>
Joe Grand (aka Kingpin) is an electrical engineer, hardware hacker,  
and president of <a href=http://www.grandideastudio.com/>Grand Idea Studio, Inc.</a>, where he specializes in the invention, design, and licensing of  
consumer products, video game accessories, and modules for electronics  
hobbyists. He also spent many years as part of hacker collective L0pht  
Heavy Industries in Boston finding security flaws in hardware devices  
and educating engineers on how to increase security of their designs.  
He.s written a few books, holds a few patents, and is also the sole  
proprietor of <a href=http://www.kingpinempire.com/>Kingpin Empire</a>, a project that  
gives back to the technology and health communities through charitable  
donations. His contributions to Prototype This can be found on his site at: <a href=http://www.grandideastudio.com/prototype-this/>www.grandideastudio.com/prototype-this</a>.

<h3>Michael Ang - <i>Gigapixels: Practice and Aesthetics</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>
Creating images with gigapixel (1 billion pixel) resolution is now
within the reach of anyone with a digital camera and computer.
Picture taking robots such as the GigaPan (developed by CMU and NASA)
and modified telescope mounts can automatically take
many overlapping pictures of a given scene. The individual pictures can be
automatically stitched together to create a large final image.  What
are the aesthetics of this increasingly accessible medium?  How does
stitching together many small images differ from taking one very large
one?
<p>
Michael (aka "Mang") first used the GigaPan in the summer of 2007,
when he took a prototype unit to Alaska by pickup truck.  This talk presents some of his work with robotically assisted
photography.  Practical aspects of creating large panoramas will be
presented as well less straightforward uses of the technology.
<p>
Mang holds a BASc in Computer Engineering from the University of
Waterloo in Canada and a Master's Degree from NYU's Interactive
Telecommunications program.  His interests include the intersection of
technology, art and physical experience.

<h3>Paul Cesewski (aka Paul da Plumber)- <i>Fun is the Universal Language</i></h3>
<table border=0>
<tr><td width=70% valign=top>
 Explore a carnival of interactive machines. People powered
contraptions delight and amuse. New and used materials are used in a
kind of contemporary alchemy. The re-animation of yesterdays dreams.
<p>
Paul's work focuses on interactive sculptures. He has worked in general contracting work, fabrication, and high-end construction for the last twenty years and has built many commissioned public art projects in the context of his own work, on collaborations, and as part of San Francisco's Bike Rodeo. 
<p>
Some of Paul's installations include: Bicycle Ferris Wheel and Bike to the Moon, Cyclefuge, Lotus Land, etc.
