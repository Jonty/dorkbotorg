</p><h3>Scott Snibbe - Body, Space, and Cinema<i></i></h3>
Working with computer vision technologies at the forefront of contemporary research, Scott Snibbe will discuss his interactive art in the context of promoting positive human behaviors including concentration, long-term engagement, and social interaction. He will show a series of large-scale body-centric physical installations created over the last fifteen years as well as his recent apps for iOS devices which have become some of the first "bestselling" works of interactive art.
<p>
Scott Snibbe is a media artist, filmmaker, and researcher in social interactivity. His interactive art spurs people to participate socially, emotionally, and physically. His works are strongly influenced by cinema: particularly animation, silent, and surrealist film; and sometimes mix actors' filmed performances with real-time audience interaction. Scott's artwork is in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York) and The Museum of Modern Art (New York).  He is the founder of two organizations: Snibbe Interactive, Inc., which distributes social interactive media; and Sona Research, which engages in educational and cultural research.
<p>
Scott holds Bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Fine Art, and a Masters in Computer Science from Brown University. He has taught media art and experimental film at Brown University, The San Francisco Art Institute, the California Institute of the Arts, The Rhode Island School of Design, and U.C. Berkeley. Earlier, Snibbe worked at Adobe Systems as a Computer Scientist making substantial contributions to Adobe After Effects. Snibbe also worked at Interval Research, researching haptics, computer vision, and interactive cinema. As a researcher, Snibbe has published numerous articles and academic papers, and is an inventor on over a dozen patents.

<h3>Garnet Hertz - <i>OutRun</i></h3>
Garnet's presentation will describe the development process of OutRun, an augmented reality video game prototype that combines a classic arcade driving game with a real world vehicle. In this project the user, or driver, drives and maneuvers the car-shaped arcade cabinet through actual physical space using a screen as a navigational guide which renders the real world in the style of an 8-bit video game. This case study is presented as a seamful augmented reality (AR) system: a project that exploits inevitable technical limitations of AR. We propose that the concept of seamfulness has important design implications for both AR and electronic media art projects and illustrate this through a detailed description of the OutRun system development process.
<p>
Garnet Hertz is a Fulbright Scholar and contemporary artist whose work explores themes of technological progress, creativity, innovation and interdisciplinarity. Doctor Hertz is a Faculty Member of the Media Design Program at the Art Center College of Design and is Assistant Director of the Computer Game Science Laboratory at UC Irvine. He has shown his work at several notable international venues in thirteen countries including SIGGRAPH, Ars Electronica, and DEAF and was awarded the prestigious 2008 Oscar Signorini Award in robotic art and is currently nominated for the Transmediale 2011 Vil√©m Flusser Theory Award. He is founder and director of Dorkbot SoCal, a monthly Los Angeles-based lecture series on DIY culture, electronic art and design. His research is widely cited in academic publications, and popular press on his work has disseminated through 25 countries including The New York Times, Wired, The Washington Post, NPR, USA Today, NBC, CBS, TV Tokyo and CNN Headline News.

<h3>Games of Nonchalance - <i>City as Platform, Play and Narrative in the Physical World: A Peek Behind the Curtain at the Jejune Institute</i></h3>
Can you really record dreams and memories to VHS? What is the potential in human-dolphin interaction? Are there cameras that can take photographs of the past? Through participation in a cross-platform narrative adventure, visitors to the Jejune institute have already found the answers to these questions. 
<p>
Through the combination of media and technologies as wide ranging as pirate radio, VCRs, binaural recordings, and sensor-driven interactive installations the Games of Nonchalance deliver four of episodes/chapters of physical narrative adventure. Each chapter is set in a  different neighborhood in San Francisco and reveals a different thread of the story. As participants explore, they find clues that  propel them physically and mentally deeper into the experience. The Games are re-playable and open to many levels of interaction, rewarding depth of participation while also offering something for the more casual participant. 
<p>
We will peel back the curtain and offer insights into the technical creation of this project as well as how the game design supports multiple levels of engagement and encourages adventure in physical space.
<p>
Sara Thacher is the lead producer and culture engineer for Nonchalance, a hybrid arts consultancy in San Francisco with an expertise in Situational Design.  Their mission is to provoke discovery through visceral experiences and pervasive play. They have worked on a diverse range of projects including the award winning 'Games of Nonchalance,' an ongoing adventure through the heart of San Francisco that begins at the real offices of the fictional 'Jejune Institute,' and most recently, 'Scoop!' an interactive game focused on citizen journalism using a live FM radio broadcast. Sara became a proficient glassblower, completed her BFA at the Rhode Island School of Design and then earned an MFA in Social Practice from the California College of the Arts. 
<p>
Uriah Findley has been creating sound experiences for Nonchalance since 2006. He first experienced the transformative power of sound on its listeners while DJing small events and local clubs in OC and LA. These gigs eventually led him to creating his own original music compositions and productions. Realizing his calling, Uriah moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he graduated from Ex'pression College with a BAS in Sound Arts. His areas of expertise are post production, interactive media, and binaural experience design and production. He has created sound installations including FM broadcast channels, podcast productions, and sound curation for various transmedia projects and experiences.
