</p><h3>Daniel Suarez - <i>Crossing the Rubicon:  Autonomous Combat Drones -- what's driving their development and their likely impact on human society</i></h3>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
From the New York Times Bestselling author of Daemon and Freedom&trade;, comes a terrifying, breathtaking, and all-too-possible vision of the world's near future. In his new novel, Kill Decision, Daniel Suarez turns to the timely and increasingly important topic of combat drones.  The book tells the story of myrmecologist Linda McKinney --a scientist studying weaver ants --who is forced to team up with a Special Ops soldier after her research is stolen and used by unknown forces to power autonomous swarming weapons.  Suarez's well researched thrillers are based on real science and technology, and in Kill Decision he takes the very real implications of automated war to its next logical step. 
<p>
Daniel Suarez is the author of the New York Times Bestseller Daemon and Freedom&trade;. A former systems consultant to Fortune 1000 companies, he has developed mission-critical software for the defense, finance, and entertainment industries.  An avid gamer and technologist, he lives in Los Angeles, California.

<h3>Alexander Rose - <i>10,000 Year Clock</i></h3>
Alexander Rose will discuss the technology and methodology of construction now underway on the 10,000 Year Clock - a monument scale icon to creatively foster long-term thinking.  The Clock, and the 500 foot tall underground space being created for it in solid rock, use a mix of the highest and lowest tech construction methods to solve design problems of extreme longevity.
<p>
Hired as the first employee of The Long Now Foundation in February of 01997. Alexander has been an artist in residence at Silicon Graphics Inc., a project manager for Shamrock Communications, and a founding partner of Inertia Labs. Alexander has attended the Art Center College of Design and graduated with a bachelor of arts honors degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Industrial Design in 01995.
<p>
As the director of Long Now, Alexander has facilitated projects such as the 10,000 Year Clock with Danny Hillis, The Rosetta Project, Long Bets, Seminars About Long Term Thinking, Long Server and others. Alexander shares several design patents on the 10,000 Year Clock with Danny Hillis, the first prototype of which is in the Science Museum of London.

<h3>Jason Wilson - <i>Seeing Yourself Seeing Your Self</i></h3>
At the OuterBody Experience Lab we use wireless video goggles and cameras to reposition the sense of sight to a position outside the participants' bodies, a camera position that gives them a view back at themselves, seeing their own bodies as if they were someone else. In this state of fractured sensorium (because there is no peripheral or calibrative sight (the subject can only see what the camera sees) the visual cortex is getting data that contradicts the data coming from the other senses) it can feel as if your own sense of self has literally relocated outside your body. Playing physical games while watching your own body from the outside explores a whole new world of gaming potential, not just "body as controller", but now "body as subject and object", "player and star", "controller and controlled". We have a handful of games and activities we have been sharing with the public through our studio nights, at festivals and at private events. Jason will talk about the history of the project, what they're doing now, where it might go in the future and why this is important.
<p>
Jason is an artist, hacker and entrepreneur. He is Founder of The OuterBody Experience Lab. Previously ran MapQuest Labs, Founded AudioPerfume. Co-Founded Platial.com. Produced publicity stunts in NYC. Started MartialArt Gallery in Portland, Oregon. Misses his tallbikes.

<h3>Parker Higgins - <i>Pwn the Drones: A Survey of UAV Hacks and Exploits</i></h3>
Drones are no longer a scary possible future of surveillance and remote force - they?~@~Yre here. Internationally, drones are being deployed for military action and observation. At home, police departments, border patrols, and others are acquiring UAVs and developing programs to fly them; there?~@~Ys even talk about adding ?~@~\less lethal?~@~] arms to these domestic drones. Think Tasers and rubber bullets shot from the sky. But a series of alarming events over the past few years have demonstrated that many of these unmanned vehicles are dangerously vulnerable to exploits, leading to intercepted data, flight failures, and even remote takeovers. In this talk, Parker and Trevor will explain the privacy and security implications of some of the most sensational drone exploits and the weaknesses that enabled them. They?~@~Yll also go over the work of communities and individuals that have been hacking drones from scratch, and what their efforts mean for our future understanding and regulation of drones.
<p>
Parker Higgins is an activist for the EFF and co-operator of the @drones
Twitter feed.
