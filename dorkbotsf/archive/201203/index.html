</p><h3>Stelarc - <i>Zombies & Cyborgs</i></h3>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
The presentation will explore varying constructs of the body in an age of Mixed Realities and Circulating Flesh. People will increasingly become portals for sensory feedback and for remote manipulation, becoming extended operational systems performing beyond the boundaries of the skin and beyond the local space they inhabit. Bodies have become chimeras of meat, metal and code.
<p>
Stelarc will show videos, animations, demonstrate the <a href=http://stelarc.org/?catID=20241>Prosthetic Head</a> project and will also show his extra ear which is presently being surgically constructed and cell-grown on his arm.
<p>
Stelarc is currently the Chair In Performance Art, School of Arts, Brunel University London, STELARC has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He has made three films of the inside of his body. Between 1976-1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin. He has used medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, Virtual Reality systems, the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body. He has performed with a Third Hand, a Stomach Sculpture and a 6-legged walking robot, Exoskeleton. In 2010 he was awarded the Hybrid Arts Prize at Ars Electronica. His artwork is represented by the Scott Livesey Galleries, Melbourne

 Club of SF, etc. and has over 150 TV spots in the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan ranging from interviews and video documentation specials t

<h3>Leo Villareal - <i>Bay Lights</i></h3>
Bay Lights is an iconic light sculpture designed by internationally renowned artist Leo Villareal. This stunning fine arts experience will live for two years on the Bay Bridge West Span starting with a Grand Lighting in late 2012.  Created with over 25,000 energy efficient, white LED lights, it is 1.5 miles wide and 500 feet high, viewable from San Francisco and points north but not by drivers on the bridge itself.
<p>
Leo Villareal orchestrates complex, rhythmic artwork composed exclusively of points of light; his groundbreaking work is part of the permanent collection of major museums worldwide.  He received a BA in sculpture from Yale University in 1990 and a graduate degree from NYU Tisch School of the Arts, Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP).

<h3>Courtney Sexton - <i>Trumpet Hero</i></h3> 
As a horn player who likes to rock'n guitar riffs, but doesnt play guitar, Courtney thought it would be fun to mash together a real trumpet with a game controller to make use of the breathing and fingerings that are used to play a brass instrument in a gaming environment

<h3>William Nye - <i>Christmas Candles Digital Logic</i></h3> 
Using the fact that electric LED candles that automatically
turns on at night (via built-in sensors) can be considered
light "inverters", the 12 Bill has attached to magnets
can be positioned into various configurations
to create flip flops (stable), ring oscillators
(unstable) and other simple digital circuits.
