<b>Stelarc</b>
<br>
Stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He has made 3 films of the inside of his body- probing two metres of space into his lungs, stomach and colon. Between 1976-1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin. He has used medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, Virtual Reality systems and the Internet to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body.  He has performed with a THIRD HAND, a VIRTUAL ARM, a STOMACH SCULPTURE and EXOSKELETON,  a 6-legged walking robot. His FRACTAL FLESH, PING BODY and PARASITE performances explored involuntary, remote and internet choreography of the body with electrical stimulation of the muscles. MOVATAR is an inverse motion capture system where an avatar can perform in the physical world by accessing and actuating a host body.  He is presently attempting to surgically construct an EXTRA EAR. His PROSTHETIC HEAD project involves an avatar which speaks to the person who interrogates it- an embodied conversational agent with real-time lip syncing and facial expression.
The MUSCLE MACHINE is a 6-legged walking machine completed in 2003, actuated by pneumatic rubber muscles
<br>
He has been awarded a 3 year Australia Council Fellowship. In 1997 he was  appointed  Honorary Professor of Art and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University.   In 2002 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate and was artist-in-residence in the Faculty of Art and Design, Monash University, Caulfield. In 2003 and 2004 he was a Visiting Artist in the Art and Technology Department at Ohio State University. He is currently Visiting Professor, School of Art and Design at The Nottingham Trent University. He has been awarded a New Media Arts Fellowship by the Australia Council for 2005-2007.  His art is represented by the Sherman Galleries in Sydney.
