<b>Andrew Bennett</b> - <i>Absorption Dye Machine</i>
<br>
Inspired by the recent debate over human genome research and biotech engineering, Andrew wanted to create a piece that would actively convey the
convergence of the natural world with science and technology, mindful of the paradigm shift from "Art in a time of mechanical reproduction"
to "Art in a time of genetic reproduction".
<p>
THE PREMISE: Download an image from the Internet and transfer that Image from the computers memory to a grid of fresh cut white carnations.
DIGITAL>ANALOG>BIOMORPHIC . Each carnation will act as a pixel using its own capillary action to absorb Systemic floral Dyes controlled by the digital
image.  During the course of the event, the white carnations transform into a color image sourcing from the Internet. The flowers reveal their pictorial presence over a three hour period as the results of the systemic dyes take effect. The images are then preserved for mounting; a combination of freeze drying, clear UV coating and suspension in an inert gas,eg.( Argon or Nitrogen ) will be used to archive the images.
<p>
Andrew will present the project to date and open up the floor to discussion Bennett is currently building a team to work on the second phase of the
project and is looking for interested programmers, engineers, designers and fabricators. Contact: ab45@earthlink.net
<p>
Andrew Bennett studied music, language and visual arts, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts, from the University of Texas.
Bennett has shown nationally and internationally including Fourteen solo exhibitions of his work since 1990, most recently at: HAINES GALLERY, San
Francisco Ca.; The Exploratorium, Palace Of Fine Arts, San Francisco, Ca.,The University Of Arizona Museum Of Art, and The Young-Une Museum of
contemporary art , Kwangju-City, Korea; In addition to numerous merit awards, Bennett received a National Endowment For The Arts, Regional
Fellowship in Painting 1996, An Adolph and EsterGottlieb Foundation Award 1993 and A Robert Rauschenberg Grant( Change Inc.)1993.

<b>Eric Paulos</b> - <i>Familiar Strangers: Anxiety, Comfort, and Play in Public Places</i>
<br>
Eric explores our often ignored yet real relationships with Familiar
Strangers - individuals we repeatedly encounter in public places that
are familiar and yet we do not directly interact.  A design for
personal, body-worn, wireless devices that extends our relationship to
urban strangers will be presented.
<p>
Eric Paulos is a Research Scientist at Intel.s new Research Laboratory in Berkeley, California.  His research interests are focused on mobile public social play, tagging, and messaging.  Eric's work is driven by observable phenomena found in public, place, and people.  Through these inspirations he explores a wide gamut of expression.  This encompasses traditional notions of expression found within the subtleties of human utterance, countenance, movement, posture, attitude, and feeling.  Equally vital to the inquiry is the discovery of novel and manifest expression using physical artifacts by exploring their representation, appearance, behavior, and actions. Eric received his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley where he researched scientific, and social issues surrounding internet based telepresence, robotics, and mediated communication tools. Eric has developed several internet based tele-operated robots including, Mechanical Gaze in 1995 and Personal Roving Presence devices (PRoPs) such as Space Browsing helium filled tele-operated blimps and ground based PRoP systems (1995-2000) (www.prop.org).  Eric is a founding member of the IEEE Technical Committee for Internet Telepresence.

<br>
Ken and team will present a sequence of systems they've built for collaboratively controlling online robots and humans using Java-based distributed audience
control, including their latest project: a new twist on studying group psychology.  (Eric Paulos, David Pescovitz, Sariel Har-Peled, Vladlen Koltun, Frank van der Stappen, and many others have contributed to this work.)

<b>Pablos</b> - <i>Wi-Fi Hackerbot (Putting the bot back in dorkbot)</i>
<br>
Pablos & Eric Johanson have built the first hacker robot.  Pablos will
bring the <a href=http://hackerbot.com/>the hackerbot</a> and talk about how hacking
and robotics go together.  Please be sure to leave all laptop computers, cellphones, and other portable electronic devices at home
(just kidding!).
<p>
Pablos is a notorious internet man of mystery.  He works on crypto,
security & privacy related projects with <a href=http://www.shmoo.com/>The Shmoo Group</a>.  
A regular at dorkbot-Seattle, he spends most of
his time implementing science fiction.
