<p>
The <b>dorkbotsf-blabber</b> list is meant for electronic/machine artists and other interested parties
to discuss issues related to making and presenting their work in the Bay Area.  It's an extension of 
the dorkbotsf meetings, but even if you can't come to the meetings in person you're still welcome to participate on the list 
<p>
<!--example topics: where do i get a flame thrower? what performance space will let me release cadaverene-filled balloons
into the audience? where is the cheapest place to get fire extinguishers? where can i get capacitors at 3am? 
what's good at HMR this week?  how do you get a permit to perform on the Embarcadero BART station and is there an AC outlet i can use on the 16th street Mission station? 
<p>
please don't send show announcements/listings/etc to the list. there are already a number of terrific SF-based events lists for those sorts of things.
