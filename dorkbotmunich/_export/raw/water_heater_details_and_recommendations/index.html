While the common life cycle of a water heater is approximately 12 years, plenty things can impact the life span of a water heater.

For safety purposes, keep the temperature dial setting at or below the recommended factory setting noted on the water heater or in the handbook. Above that setting will substantially raise the opportunity for scalding. 

All water heaters are obligated by law to be furnished with a temperature and pressure relief valve (t & p valve) as a safety feature to avoid damage from severe pressure (> 150 psi) or temperature (> 210 degress). If the t & p valve is expeling water you should call your plumber at once.

Flushing your water heater is something that needs to be done on a consistent basis. The course of action is as follows:

-  Hook a lawn hose up to the bottom drain valve. Place the garden hose in a position to permit complete discharge of the water through the hose (into a floor drain, bath tub or street). NOTE: THIS WATER WILL BE SCORCHING AND IS A SCALD RISK! THE TEMPERATURE COULD KILL PLANTS.

-  Open the drain valve wide open. DO NOT CLOSE OFF THE INCOMING COLD WATER SUPPLY TO THE HEATER.

-  Run the water out of the hose till the water runs clear (commonly just a few seconds).

-  Once the water is clear, turn off the bottom drain valve and take off the garden hose.

How many years might my water heater last? The answer is not simple. 

-  Water softeners are employed to decrease hardness in water, they are able to lessen the life a water heater by consuming the anode rod fairly quickly (ordinarily within one year). As soon as the anode rod is consumed there is no protection in the water heater to prevent the water from dissolving the seam joints. When a water softener is installed the water softener ought to be bypassed annually to permit some lime to buildup to preserve the heater and slow down the anode rod consumption

-  Thermal expansion can create quite high pressures and usually manifest itself by premature failure of the water tank or leaking t & p relief valves. Thermal expansion is ordinarily only an issue on a closed plumbing system.

-  Under sizing of a water heater makes it to be "on" much more frequently than a correctly sized water heater. This could cause parts to go downhill much sooner than expected.
 
-  Mineral deposits and buildup are destructive and act as an insulator involving the heat source (burner or elements) and the water, leading to the water heater to work harder to control the temperature.

-  Missing anode rod because of water quality or removal of anode rod.

If you have a question or worry about any one of these issues involving your water heater, you should call your plumber.
