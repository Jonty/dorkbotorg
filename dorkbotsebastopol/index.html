people doing strange things with electricity

The first three meetings were great!
<b>Fourth  Meeting</b><br>
<b>Time:</b> 7:00pm Wednesday Feb 13th, 2008 (come at 6:00 for possible soup or pizza, and early chatting)<br>
<b>Place:</b> Rich Gibson's house: 241 Florence Ave, Sebastopol, CA  95472<br>
<b>Events:</b>
<li>Steve Chalem has an arduino and motor controllers, other things are happening!



<b>Third  Meeting</b><br>
<b>Time:</b> 7:00pm Wednesday February 6th, 2008 (come at 6:00 for possible soup or pizza, and early chatting)<br>
<b>Place:</b> Rich Gibson's house: 241 Florence Ave, Sebastopol, CA  95472<br>
<b>Events:</b>
This was a great meeting!  Steve showed off his kinetic sculpture.  Brad showed
a cool project he did with his ShopBot and did
a little intro on motors and demonstrated stepper motor control, Steamboat Ed
showed the work he has on a flame callilope, and we talked about making a
machine to paint bodies, and alternate power generation.
<p>
Ed is convertign geo metro engines into steam engines, and once you have a 
steam engine you _almost_ have a steam turbine.  And if you can control a device
to paint boobies you can control a heliostat solar concentrator to drive that
steam turbine.
<p>
Stop thinking about the boobies, focus on the steam turbine from step 1.

<br>And coming up Brad Silva is working on a session <b>From Electrons to Magnetisim 
to Motion</b> an introduction to fairly cheap motors and how to control them.</b>

<b>Second Meeting</b><br>
<b>Time:</b> 7:00pm Wednesday January 16th, 2008 (come at 6:00 for possible soup or pizza, and early chatting)<br>
<b>Place:</b> Rich Gibson's house: 241 Florence Ave, Sebastopol, CA  95472<br>
<b>Events:</b>
<ul>
<li>This is a hack night, bring projects, show projects, and build stuff!
<li>Group Project Discussion!  
<li>I have two half assembled Brain Machines we can mess with, or we can
shoot the breeze and drink beer.
<li>Dorkbot free table - I have stuff I want to get rid of, do you?  Bring it, give it away.  The only (initial) rule
is if no one wants it you need to take it back with you.
</ul>
Steve Chalem and I chatted, and he writes: "I'd like to find others in the group interested in working on a joint
project; something fun, creative, and possibly burningman-bound.
<p>
Rich and I have talked about this and come up with a couple of ideas: an
abstract robotic sculpture; and a body-painting machine.  I'm hoping
that people interested in working on this will elaborate more on these
ideas, or suggest new ideas, or just get enthusiastic over one of our
ideas!"

<p>
Think of the possibilities in a body painting machine!
