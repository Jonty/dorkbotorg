			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the successful (except for my ranting grumbles) inaugural meet and greet. I am planning another meeting. For the next few meetings I will be running a series of presentations so you all can connect with each other&#8217;s work more thoroughly, and strengthen your networks.</p>
<p>These presentations will include live demos of the works being discussed.</p>
<p>Due to this I am relocating the meeting to The Studio of Electronic Art @ Curtin University so that presenters can set up safely away from the boozers (yes I will still be attending) and have access to a faster network/multiple rooms and projectors.</p>
<p>This will be a filmed event and a lot of fun! Documentation from the presentations will possibly be included in the 10 year Dorkbot worldwide publication we Overlords are currently negotiating (yes even though we have just started we have been allowed in the publication so we have to make up for lost time quickly!!)</p>
<p>I would like to invite all members interested in presenting their work over the next few months to submit a paragraph detailing their project and a rough time (name your month!) you would feel most prepared to present. Projects can range from robotics, film/video, animation, interfacing; professional/independent/Uni-based; Sound; etc etc.</p>
<p>The first of these presentations will be held on the 31st January (it&#8217;s a Sunday afternoon).</p>
<p>Please either message me via FB or email <a href="mailto:j.stadon@curtin.edu.au">j.stadon@curtin.edu.au</a></p>
<p>In other news, we got a mention by the CEO for the Australian Network for Art and Technology, Gavin Artz which is always a nice thing so thanks Gavin! :</p>

<p>Look forward to hearing from you!</p>
