An overview of Holography is given with reference to its origins, techniques and methods. The various technical applications of holography and its usage are covered in widely differing areas such as security, the internet,  industrial optics and imaging systems. The use of holography as an artists' medium is shown, along with specific examples of holographic artwork.<br>
Joy has previously worked for American Bank Note Holographics in the laser lab, where she produced several well-known images such as the MasterCard hologram, and security holograms for Intel and USPS.  After meeting Dinesh Padiyar - a fellow holographer and scientist, they both moved to San Diego and established their own company, Triple Take Holographics, featuring both high-tech applications and commercial uses of holograms.

This is an impromptu event - come on up to Norton Sales!  We did this as a Dorkbot excursion in May 2007, and was a lot of fun.  Here are some pics of the last event: <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/youraccount/sets/72157600183546485/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/youraccount/sets/72157600183546485/</A><BR>
<BR>
Here's some info on Norton Sales:<BR>
<BR>
"Norton Sales has been a leading supplier of Aerospace and Industrial
supplies since 1962. Our customers tend to be small shops and
individuals who are looking for very specific, and often hard to find,
parts for rocketry, stunt equipment, movie props and old school
hydraulics."<BR>
<BR>
Long story short: it's an aerospace junk / surplus dealer that is completely surreal. Norton Sales may be of interest to hackers, people interested in aerospace technologies, STS folk, nerds, etc. or just people looking for something random and interesting to do.  Unlike many junkyards, there is also no age restriction (like bringing kids) to the place - so feel free to bring kids along if you like.<BR>
<BR>
Come on out, bring some money, your friends and some dirty clothes.<BR>

<br>
Introduction by Peter Testa / Devyn Weiser<br>
Demonstration by Brandon Kruysman / Jonathan Proto<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciarc.edu/portal/about/resources/robotics_lab.html">SCI-Arc Robotics and Simulation Lab (SRSL)</a>, initiated and designed by
faculty members Peter Testa and Devyn Weiser, builds upon the school's
strengths to create a next generation platform for experimentation and
speculation on the future of architecture. Situated conceptually and
physically between studio and shop, school and industry, SRSL is more
than simply a logical progression in digital tooling. The lab offers
the opportunity to develop a unique, institute specific position in
the emerging field of robotics in architecture.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/2011-dorkbotsocal47-sciarc.jpg" WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="864"><br>
<br>
The 1,000 square-foot double height robot cell focuses on multi-robot
collaboration and multi-media simulation using 5 state-of-the-art
Staubli robot systems: (2) RX160, (2) TX90, and (1) TX90L. The
relatively lightweight, six-axis robotic arms are in a range of
positions (floor and ceiling mounted) to create a reconfigurable 3D
work space with many possible applications. The adjacent simulation
lab houses the Staubli TX40 robot where students, along with their
instructors, conduct hands-on training and testing.<BR>

xtine is a media artist, educator, editor of Net Works: Case Studies
in Web Art and Design (Routledge 2011) and co-author of Digital
Foundations (New Riders/AIGA 2009). Informed by the history of
conceptual art, she uses social networking, databases, search engines,
blogs, and applications in combination with popular sites like
Facebook, YouTube, or Mechanical Turk, to create web communities
promoting interpretation and autonomy. xtine believes art shapes
social experiences by mediating consumer culture with rebellious
practices. As an associate professor of communication at CSUF, shebridges the gap between histories, theories, and production in design
and new media education. Her website is <A HREF="http://missconceptions.net">http://missconceptions.net</A>
.<BR><BR>"Net Works: Case Studies in Web Art and Design" offers an inside look into the process of successfully developing thoughtful, innovative digital media. In many practice-based art texts and classrooms, technology is
 divorced from the socio-political concerns of those using it. Although there are many resources for media theorists, practice-based students sometimes
find it difficult to engage with a text that fails to relate theoretical concerns to the act of creating. Net Works strives to fill that gap.Using websites as case studies, each chapter introduces a different style of web project--from formalist play to social activism to data visualization--and then includes the artists' or entrepreneurs' reflections o
n the particular challenges and outcomes of developing that web project. Scholarly introductions to each section apply a
theoretical frame for the projects. Beyond project summaries, chapters also include an explanation of the w
ebsites' technological components; historical, cultural, and ethical perspectives; a list of links; key wor
ds; and short online exercises that relate technical skills to individual projects. Combining practical ski
lls for web authoring with critical perspectives on the web, Net Works is ideal for courses in new media design, art, communication, critical studies, media and technology, or popular digital/internet culture.<BR><BR><A HREF="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415882224/"><IMG SRC="./img/2011july-burrough-networks-500x716.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=716 ALT="Net Works: Case Studies in Web Art and Design (Routledge 2011)" BORDER=0></A><BR><BR><B>2.

<BR>
Jeremy Rotsztain is a Canadian digital artist who, taking cues from the practice of painting, works with movies, images, and sound as a kind of malleable and expressive material. In his work, popular narratives, pixels, and sound bites are sampled, transformed, re-arranged and composed in an effort to examine the language and patterns of contemporary media and the shared cultural experiences that we have with them. Jeremy writes custom software, enabling him to collect, edit, and compose with his materials in hybrid and unconventional ways that aren't supported by existing commercial software applications. His work has been screened, performed and exhibited at the Cooper Hewitt and the New York Hall of Science in NYC, Urban Screens in Melbourne, Subtle Technologies and InterAccess in Toronto, Electric Fields in Ottawa, SAT in Montreal, and New Forms Festival in Vancouver.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Action Painting is a series of animated digital paintings composed using cinematic gestures from Hollywood action flicks. Moving visual elements from popular action films -- explosions, fistfights, car chases, and gunshots-- are used as compositional material to create works in the style of abstract expressionist painters such as Jackson Pollock. Action Painting brings together the adrenalin-filled culture of action cinema and the formalist canon of modernist painting. It is a line of inquiry into spontaneity and self-expression that contrasts user-generated web 2.0 culture against the work of the genius craftsman -- and reflects cinema's use of violence as pure spectacle.<BR>

This is a special holiday edition of Dorkbot SoCal, held at perhaps the most ambitious light display in Southern California.  We'll meet at the driveway of Ric Turner at 7pm on Tuesday December 28th 2010, and he'll demo and explain his latest Christmas Light video game project, Snowball Blaster.<BR><BR>
Ric Turner is a former Disney Imagineer who created special effects
for theme park attractions and shows such as Space Mountain, TheHaunted Mansion, and the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage.<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Snowball Blaster Description</B><BR><BR>Hop in Santa's electric training sled and grab the game controller for an adventure in snowball dodging. Press the left button to move left and the right to move right. Make it past all the snowballs for a big light show! (nobody has made it yet!) Game is easy enough
 for kids and challenging for adults... and quite addictive.<BR>
<BR>Snowball Blaster has 128 channels of Light-o-rama controlled by a PC. The game logic is running on a Basic Stamp which accepts inputs from the player switches and controls the Red Arrows with sold state relays. The BS also sends logic level triggers to the LOR system
 for Game start and Crash. The snowballs, scoreboard (and the rest of the light show live
 in the LOR program.) There are separate LOR programs for Attract, Crash and Game play. T
he BS knows when the snowballs reach the bottom, and compares that to where it knows the 
Arrow is to detect crashes.<BR>
<BR>
The game is designed around the limitation of having very few positions to light up. The timing of when they light up is more versatile, so that's where the game lives. It's easy to learn, starts easy and gets harder pretty quick. The audio is broadcast on FM so people watching in cars get a good show too.<br>

<a href="http://www.davidresnick.me/">http://www.davidresnick.me/</a><br>
<br>
Undulating Flux is David's first-year project in the Arts Computation Engineering program
 at UC Irvine.
The goal of Undulating Flux is to bring the participant into what psychologist Mihalyi Cs
ikszentmihalyi termed a flow state,
described as a state of being wherein action follows upon action according to an internal
 logic that seems to need no conscious intervention by the participant.
Undulating Flux explores these questions by setting up a transduction chain wherein a vib
rationist sends intense music and motion-synced vibrations into the participants body.The technology behind this project centers around the Nintendo Wii remote and the Max programming environment. The wiimote data is streamed into Max wherein parameters are set to control the intensity of each vibrator individually. A Max package called Maxuino is used to send the control data to an Arduino microcontroller, which is connected to the motor
s.

The Freephone is an art project that aims to provide people just deported
from the US with a free phone call. To achieve this, a group of UCSD
MFA students and graduates came together to
present the phone at the Lui Velazquez gallery in Tijuana, just a few feet
from the turnstiles where people who are deported are dropped off by the
border patrol. The project is by Chris Head, Micha C&aacute;rdenas, Elle Mehrmand
,
Katherine Sweetman, Felipe Zu&ntilde;iga and Camilo Ontiveros
<br>
<br>
The Freephone is an effort to use new media performance art or performance
with technology to make the experience that people who are deported from
the US a little bit less difficult. To make the phone, the artists bought
a non working payphone casing from Ebay.com, wired it to a new $10 phone
from a store and hooked that up to an adapter which would allow the phone
to make calls over the internet. Then, the phone was installed outside of
the Lui Velazquez gallery and the artists invited people coming through the
turnstiles at the border to make a free phone call.

Leaving No trace, the Parkfield Interventional EQ Fieldwork (PIEQF)
was a geologically interactive machine earthwork temporarily installed
in the remote township of Parkfield, Central California during the
summer of 02008. This time-sharing, performance earthwork merged
together the micro-seismic resonance of geological time and the
autonomous operation of a ready-made, modified machine, producing an
immersive, digitally mapped 21st century machine earthwork action.<br>

<br>
Owen Gerst is engaged in the process of architecture, but casts aside the
title of architect.  He is a representative of ideas, and draws a distinction
between building and architecture.  Building serves basic raw needs.
Architecture is about something - an IDEA.  It is the IDEA that, through the
creative process, serves as the catalyst in a process of transformation -
turning the very basic into something special, unique, and magnificent.
The IDEA is the essence of architecture, and it is the IDEA that Gerst is
interested in - the IDEA in all its forms and methods of representation.

(including museum shows) centers on the relationship between
collective memory and power, from special effects to cinema to digital
theory, usually set in urban spaces; and often on the thin line
between fact and fiction; about erasure, forgetting, scripted spaces,

Through careful social conditioning, the mind is guided to think
within certain patterns. Gil Kuno tries to redirect the flow of the
mind outside of the set patterns we are taught by society to
construct. Most of his works displace natural activity from its
context, revealing an otherwise hidden level of metaphorical absurdity
within the ordinary patterns present before our eyes. Much of his work
revolves around the experience of sound. Gil Kuno is based in Tokyo
and Los Angeles.

Hear the gut-wrenching tale of four plucky men and a crappy car who made a fooli
sh fantasy into a foolish reality!<BR><BR>Earlier this year, Make: magazine agreed to sponsor Jason Torchinsky in fielding an entry into the 2008 <a href="24hoursoflemons.com" target="new">24 Hours of Lemons</a> motor race: an endurance race for cars valued at $500 or less. Jason gathered the best people in the field of enough free time and some interest in ra
cing a shitbox: Tom Jennings, Brett Doar, and Sloan Fader. A 1993 Ford Escort LX
 was purchased for $300, and the work began.<BR><BR>In the end, The Make:Way car came in 33rd out of nearly 90 entries-- a far bette
r result than ever hoped for. Come see what the team did, how they did it, and s
ee the 33rd-place-winning car itself! <BR>

Damon Seeley and partner Cameron McNall are Electroland, a team
that creates large-scale public art projects and electronic installations.
Each project is site-specific and may employ a broad range of media,
including light, sound, images, motion, architecture and interactivity.
Electroland is working at the forefront of new technologies to create
interactive experiences where visitors can interact with buildings,
spaces and each other in new and exciting ways.<BR>

Thomas Edwards is a technology artist who is a recent transplant
from Washington, DC (where he co-founded Dorkbot DC).
He will be presenting "Phy2Phy", his campaign to link physical
objects to other physical objects using the Interent.  Phy2Phy
concentrates on de-localization of interaction through the use of
affordable hardware devices, and parallels the displacement of
his own recent transcontinental journey.<BR>

<BR>
Gilad works to explore the intersection between culture, technology
and spatial design, made possible through new media. What gets
him excited is finding ways to create and use technology as a tool
to strengthen connections between people and to places. He builds
objects and designs spaces that take advantage of embedded
technology as a way to augment their base line functionality.

Meet at Machine Project @ 1pm on Saturday, December 1st 2007.  We will have Dorkbot there.  Presenters are as follows:<BR>

<BR>
Today's digital cameras have a limited dynamic range compared to
film.  If you shoot a photo of a landscape with a beautiful cloudy
sky, your landscape will be properly exposed, but your clouds will be
washed out or vice-versa.  High-Dynamic Range photography allows you
to circumvent your sensor's limitations by taking multiple photos with
different exposures and combining them on your computer.    All you
need is a camera capable of manual exposure settings, a tripod and a
computer and you'll be on your way to HDR mastery.<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://davebullock.com/">Dave Bullock</a> (<a href="http://eecue.com/
">eecue</a>) is the offspring of a photographer and a programmer. He
has been sifting through bits on the internet since he was young and
along the way has taught himself programming, unix and photography.
Dave is a frequent contributor to <a href="http://
www.wired.com/">WIRED News</a> and a member of the <a href="http://cave.sbsar.org/
">San Bernardino Sheriff's Search and Rescue Team</a>.  When he's not
shooting photo of geeky stuff around Los Angeles, you can usually find
him crawling through a cave, out in the desert or rescuing a wayward
hiker.<BR>

<BR>
Rama will present a range of projects, including videos of mechnical and
robotic sculptures, self-organizing systems and systems for knowledge
organization. Themes will include the relationship between physical
(embodied) and non-physical (mental) activity, knowledge representation,
and systems of belief. The relationship of these projects to the
interdisciplinary questions raised by intelligent systems will be
introduced with the intention of engaging in an open discussion.<BR>
<BR>

Rama Hoetzlein completed a BA in Computer Science, a BFA in Fine Arts
from Cornell University in 2001 with thesis works in robotic sculpture.
 From 2002 to 2004, he co-founded the Game Design Initiative at Cornell
University (GDIAC) in 2001, with David Schwartz, to support
interdisciplinary education among artists and engineers. In 2007, Rama
completed an MS with the Media Arts & Technology Program (MAT) at UC
Santa Barbara in the area of knowledge organization, and is currently
doing research in artificial intelligence and computer graphics.<BR>

In conjunction with Dorkbot Socal, I will be throwing open the doors to Hooptyrides, Inc. but space is limited. Attendance will be restricted to the first thirty respondents per Dorkbot instructional internet presence (Link). One lucky attendee will leave with a door prize/boat anchor which will be won through a rousing round of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The contest portion of the evening will be officiated by Echo Park superhero, Mark Allen (Link). Mark doesn't know that he will be performing in this capacity, so if you happen to see him, please urge him to attend. Perhaps you should suggest that he bring a whistle.<BR>

<IMG SRC="img/2007-oct-misterjalopy-doorrrize.jpg"><BR>
You may ask, why do I have to win that console?<BR>
<BR>
When I built the Giant Ipod, I had purchased/found three consoles as I was not sure which would work for my purposes. This is #2 of the three. If I find the 3rd, which is pretty likely, there may be two door prizes! What a lucky day that will be!<BR>

Meet at Machine Project @ 1pm.  We will be driving up to Norton at 1:10pm sharp.  Maps will be left at Machine to help get you there.  Alternately, you can just meet up at Norton at around 1:30pm.  Note that the store closes at 3pm.<BR>
<BR>
The goal of this event is this: get to Norton, buy something, and make something interesting with it in the month ahead.  Bring it back to the next Dorkbot SoCal event, and the best object wins a free copy of the beautifully produced <A HREF="http://www.lulu.com/content/643702">Machine Project Almanac v1.1</A>, featuring a <A HREF="http://flickr.com/photos/youraccount/sets/72157600094554611/">bunch of previous events</A>.  If you're better at photography or some other alternate skill, you're also welcome to take photos, document yourself at Norton doing something, etc. and also present it - anything goes.<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Norton Sales has been a leading supplier of Aerospace and Industrial supplies since 1962. Our customers tend to be small shops and individuals who are looking for very specific, and often hard to find, parts for rocketry, stunt equipment, movie props and old school hydraulics.

This event will be on the theme of <B>3D imaging technologies and systems</B>, and it's been in the making for a number of months. The event - organized with the help of Eric Kurland - will showcase some devices that have been informally demo'd at previous events, and also have presentations by two respected pioneers in 3D/stereo imaging technologies: Ray Zone and John A. Rupkalvis.<BR>
<BR>
Come on out and bring your friends - seating is limited, and we'll be projecting/demonstrating in 3D: we'll be handing out stereo glasses to folks in the crowd... so come early.  We will have some incredible hardware on site, too.  Personally, I've seen Ray Zone recently present at USC: it was interesting, articulate and intelligent.<BR>

<p><A HREF="http://www.machineproject.com">Machine Project</A>, <a href="http://www.makezine.com">Make Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.superbunker.com">Superbunker</a> are very excited to announce DORKBAKE! (Dorkbot SoCal is, of course, fully supportive of this effort too.)</p>
<p>What we know at this time:</p>
<p>1. We are inviting teams or individuals to construct small baking ovens using only the heat of a 100-watt incandescent bulb.</p>
<p>2. The makers of said ovens shall compete in a public bake-off with said ovens on the evening of Feb 3rd. Ingredients will be provided to all competitors at the event.</p>
<p>3. Winners shall be judged on engineering, aesthetics and tastiness. Prizes include subscriptions to <a href="http://www.makezine.com">MAKE</a> and <a href="http://craftzine.com/">CRAFT</a>, a free class at Machine, electronic kits and other goodies.</p>

<p>4. The name Easy-Bake Oven is property of Hasbro and shall not be mentioned again. Except for here:<BR>

We'll start this event with a demo by <B>Bob Blackstock from Laminar Sciences Corporation</B>: he'll be bringing and demoing some patent-pending "streaming birefringence" devices that produce extraordinarily interesting and colorful flow visualizations.  It's like a combination of kaleidoscope, Etch-a-Sketch, and Lava Lamp with swirling colors spontaneously appear then disappear. Bob is exploring aesthetic and technical applications for these devices, including flow visualization for fluid mechanics and aerodynamics. See <A HREF="http://www.laminarsciences.com/id11.html">http://www.laminarsciences.com/id11.html</A> for videos of this gear in action.<BR>
<BR>
After Bob's demo, we'll be breaking into an <B>"Open Hack"</B>: bring your scrap junk, ideas, in-progress devices, and completed projects.  We'll bring out the tables and tools and hack away and chat for about an hour.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="./img/dorkbotsocal20-makemag.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="15">
At the end of the event, we'll be announcing and taking registrations for our <B>"Dorkbake" contest</B>.  Basically, people can register in the contest to have a month to build an oven using only a 100 watt incandescent for heat. The event finale is a cook off to be held on February 3rd 2007, where contestants are judged on flavor, engineering and aesthetics. Make Magazine and Craft are giving away subscriptions, Machine Project is giving away a free class or two, and some books. There may even be more prizes.  Mark Frauenfelder and Carla Sinclair (Make and Craft editors) are going to judge. Other impressive judges are in the works.  Contest details will be announced at the event.<BR>
<BR>
And, as if this wasn't enough encouragement, the winner of the contest will also win a photo of their project in the beautiful hardcopy of Make magazine.<BR>
<BR>
So, come on out... and bring your friends, gear, and ideas.<BR>

<A HREF="http://ace.uci.edu/~gelliott/personalsoundtrack/">http://ace.uci.edu/~gelliott/personalsoundtrack/</A><BR>
<BR>
PersonalSoundtrack, a tiny wearable computer, detects your walking or running speed and plays songs from your music library that match your pace. Song speed is adjusted in real-time to match subtle variations in your gait, while larger, deliberate pace changes cause the device to change songs.  You simply put it on and begin moving;  that's it.<BR>
<BR>
Most computational devices require the user to adapt to the machine.  PersonalSoundtrack offers, instead, a symbiotic relationship: both human and machine actively adapt to each other in real-time.  The 'interface' is one's natural gait. There is no optimal or pre-defined experience, encouraging meandering, wasting time, and loitering.

<BR>
This will be an "open hack", and will be a repeat of our highly
successful May "electronic disassembly" event where people brought a
variety of electronic devices to rip apart while chatting.  Come on
out and bring in something that you've never seen the insides of: an
old VCR, toaster, alarm clock, keyboard, camera or a piece of
industrial surplus.  If you've never taken anything apart, don't be
intimidated: this activity is for both newbies and experienced folks.
To help rip apart your electronics, you're also welcome to bring some
of your own tools in case things get busy and the "house" tools get
monopolized.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that this event will be held on SUNDAY, not Saturday (as usual).<BR>
<BR>
In addition to your objects of deconstruction, Tom Jennings will give
a demo of http://wps.com/projects/MP3-system/index.html - a computer
music system for his 1970 AMC Hornet.  This is an linux-based MP3
player operated by 2 knobs and 2 switches, with no visible computer
controls.<BR>
<BR>
If you have your own projects to demo, bring them out too.<BR>
<BR>
So, come on out on Sunday... bring your ideas and something to rip
apart.  The last event like this was a lot of fun: hope to see you
there!<BR>

<BR>
This event, in "Dorkbot-ish" fashion, is a diverse blend of three presentations that all relate to inhabited environments: but in a completely different realm than Bed Bath & Beyond.  Samuel Coniglio, Vice President of the Space Tourism Society, will show us products he's designed for life in space: including, of course, a zero-gravity martini glass.  Jennifer Silbert, an L.A.-based architect, will bring us into the interesting world of designing and working with highly original custom architectural materials. Lastly, Tod E. Kurt will bring an entourage of Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners and show us how to modify them to play music and do other unexpected things.<BR>
<BR>
So, come on out and bring your friends. As with all events, this is free of charge. If you would like to make a donation to our kind venue-host (Machine Project), bring some dollar bills and watch them get sucked up in the money-sucking-machine. Also, most lecture events are filled to capacity, so if you want a chair, it might be a good idea to come at 12:50.<BR>

Samuel Coniglio is photographer, designer and promoter for the space tourism industry. His photographs document the evolution of the private space industry, focusing on the  pioneers and their vehicles. In 2004, he photographed the historic flights of Space Ship One, the world's first successful private spaceship. He designs robots and other products specifically for the zero gravity lifestyle. Samuel is Vice President of the Space Tourism Society, which promotes the nascent space tourism industry, and a member of the Space Frontier Foundation, which promotes free trade in orbit. Since 1997, he has presented papers, run conferences and conducted seminars on space tourism in the USA, Great Britain, and Germany.<BR>

<BR>
Jennifer will present on the technology and process of designing new materials for architectural projects.  One project is the renovation of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts - Alice Tully Hall - in New York.  This project features translucent wood panels that are 2" thick to meet the acoustic requirements of the concert hall. In addition, the panels have complex curves, meaning that the material must also be heat-formable. The research and development of this material took over 3 months of testing various adhesion and lamination techniques. This presentation will provide an overview of the digital data modelling, structural design, hardware design, prototyping, fabrication and assembly of the project. Jennifer Silbert is a practicing architect in Los Angeles and a graduate of the Yale School of Architecture.<BR>

<BR>
Tod will show how a Roomba can be a MIDI synth or make room-sized Spirographs, as well as demonstrate what a good platform for robotics experimentation the Roomba has become.  The cheap hardware and software needed to hack a Roomba will be shown and discussed.  Tod E. Kurt is the author of the upcoming book "Hacking Roomba". He has engineered the hardware and software for robotic camera systems that went to Mars.  He was a founding developer and systems architect of Overture Systems, n&eacute;e GoTo.com, later sold to Yahoo.  Now as co- creator of ThingM.com, he's designing sketchable hardware and networked portable objects.  He has degrees in Electrical Engineering from Caltech and Physics from Occidental College.  His robotics hacking began at the age twelve when he took apart his BigTrak, RC car, and chemistry set box to build an upright programmable robot.<BR>

This will be the third "open hack" event, with a workshop/activity in the disassembly of an electronic device.  In other words, come on out and bring something interesting to rip apart: Tom Jennings will provide an overview of some disassembly issues and get us all rolling.  Bring in something that you've never seen the insides of: an old VCR, toaster, alarm clock, keyboard, camera or a piece of industrial surplus.  If you've never taken anything apart, don't be intimidated: this activity is for both newbies and experienced folks.  To help rip apart your electronics, you're also welcome to bring some of your own tools in case things get busy and the "house" tools get monopolized.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to your objects of deconstruction, you are also invited to bring your latest prototypes, napkin sketches, and items to get technical help or conceptual feedback on.  This has been an increasingly fruitful part of the open hack events as people become more comfortable to share their ideas and projects.<BR>
<BR>
We will also be featuring a short presentation by Brian Hart, the director of the Southern California Science Cafe - a relatively laid-back forum for scientists to give informal presentations about fresh-from-the-lab discoveries.  It looks like a very interesting project, and it will be good to hear more about what Brian's been up to.<BR>
<BR>
So, come on out on Saturday... bring your latest project/idea and something to rip apart.  It's shaping up to be a great event - hope to see you there.<BR>

<BR>
If a theme for this event had to be chosen, I'd pick "Making the
Invisible Visible".  This month's event will feature a good variety of
work from a number of different angles: social software, locative
media and digital cinema.  Mark Daggett, most well-known (perhaps) as
being part of the Radical Software Group that won a Golden Nica at Ars
Electronica 2002, will be presenting "Balance Bar" - a browser
extension programmed to allow any user to editorialize any web page
anywhere on the Internet. Naomi Spellman & Brandon Stow from 34 North
118 West will be showing "Interpretive Engine for Various Places on
Earth", a system that uses outdoor wireless network connections to
design a custom-built narrative specific to geographical location,
including factors like weather conditions, the physical environment,
nearby locales, and historic events.  Michael Lew will also be
presenting: he's a media artist and research engineer that primarily
works on expanding cinema, and has a background in electrical
engineering, artificial intelligence, performance and filmmaking.<BR>
<BR>
Come on out - bring your friends.  This event is free of charge.  If
you would like to make a donation to our kind venue-host (Machine

"Balance Bar"</B><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.flavoredthunder.com/">http://www.flavoredthunder.com/</A><BR>
<BR>
"In my artwork, I primarily make tools for use by others. The tools that
I create are computer applications, which are commonly referred to as "social
software" or "art applications". My ongoing social software research
is in the area of "independent interfaces," a term I coined to
describe my artistic production and academic research. (The term also
is the title of my related book project.) Independent interfaces are
artistic augmentations to conventional technology that help people
understand how social software can alter their lives in positive and
not-so-positive ways. My interfaces are developed to illuminate and
measure the often-elusive effects of social software on our culture.
A good example of my work in social software is an on-going project
called the "Balance Bar" (http://www.collcoll.com/balancebar/). The
"Balance Bar" is a simple  browser extension programmed to allow any
user to editorialize any web page anywhere on the Internet. The
"Balance Bar" will literally insert your comments/article/rant
directly onto whatever web page you would like to expound on. The
"Balance Bar" was developed to address the increasing need to
"balance" the one-sided and isolated worldview that much of our media
sources produce."<BR>
<BR>
Mark Daggett is an artist and programmer, whose work has been shown in
museums, festivals and exhibitions around the world. His work has
shown in the Whitney Museum, the Princeton Museum, P.S. 1, the Ars
Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, and the Transmediale festival
in Berlin, to name a few. As a member of Radical Software Group, he
was part of a team that won a Golden Nica award for the project
Carnivore at the 2002 Ars Electronica Festival. Daggett have been
nominated for several prestigious awards, including a 2006 Rockefeller
New Media Grant, and a Webby Award, which is sometimes called the
Oscars of the Internet. Major media sources have covered Daggett's
work, including the New York Times, Le Monde, WIRED Magazine and
Surface Magazine. He is presently Creative Manager for Revver a Social
Software company based in Hollywood.<BR>

"Interpretive Engine for Various Places on Earth"</B><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.34n118w.net/">http://www.34n118w.net/</A><BR>
<BR>
Naomi Spellman and Brandon Stow will discuss The Interpretive Engine
for Various Places on Earth, a project with Jeff Knowlton. A work in
progress, this generative narrative relies on outdoor wireless
Internet connection to tell a story specific to user location. Data
such as weather conditions, the physical environment, nearby locales,
historic events  all specific to the current location and time  are
retrieved from online sources and fed into a scripted story structure.
The negotiation of remote databases uncovers larger issues of social
control and power among governmental, commercial, and academic
interests.<BR>
<BR>
34 North 118 West is a southern California based collective focusing
on site specific experimental works utilizing digital media,
computation, and internet resources. Through telecommunications and
mapping tools, one of their concerns is to expose or call to light the
debate around control of and access to information. Their work has
been shown at Futuresonic <4> (Manchester, UK), the LA Freewaves
Festival (Los Angeles), and the Art in Motion in Festival (Los
Angeles). The "interpretive engine" will be shown in the Fresno
Metropolitan Museum's Off-site series, June - August 2006. Naomi,
Jeff, and Brandon are affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Computing
Arts Program at UC San Diego.<BR>

"I will be presenting some ongoing research project about "Human
behaviour control". Combining the electronic art attempts of tapping
into the nervous/muscular system (roachbot, Stelarc, Artifacial
expression) and the influence of video game control into live
interactive entertainment, I will present a project where live actors
can be controlled by the audience. It's better than Office Voodoo, the
Sims or reality TV. After a background talk surveying the field, I
will present a demo with live actors of my work-in-progress
prototype."<BR>
<BR>
Michael Lew is a media artist and research engineer, with backgrounds
in electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, performance and
filmmaking. From 2001-2004, he was a Research Fellow at the MIT Media
Lab Europe in Dublin, Ireland, investigating what happens to the film
form when the medium becomes computational. Michael's interactive film
installations and live experimental videos have been shown in
electronic art festivals across Europe and the US. Michael obtained
his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology (EPFL), with a masters thesis on software agents from
the AI Lab, Motorola Labs in Paris, France, for which he was awarded
the Logitech 2000 prize. In 97-98, he was developing architectures for
MPEG-2 video streaming at the Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa,
Israel.<BR>

<BR>
This will be the second "open hack" event, with an added bonus: come
on out for a "how to solder" demo by Garnet Hertz.<BR>
<BR>
The "open demo" is an opportunity for you to bring projects that
you've been working on and to get technical or conceptual feedback on
them.  During the last open hack event we had a number of folks bring
out completed projects, project ideas, and specific technical
questions.  We're looking for more of the same: this should be a good
time to bring works in progress, get feedback/help, and see what
others are doing.<BR>
<BR>
The "how to solder" portion of the event will be an instructional demo
that will be catered toward people that are beginning with
electronics: Garnet will be showing the basics of soldering.  The
tools and supplies for this workshop will be provided... and is free
of charge.<BR>
<BR>
So: grab your stuff, tools, sketches, ideas and friends and come on
out on Saturday March 4th at 1pm to Machine Project.<BR>

This event will focus on how Processing - an open source programming
language and environment for people who want to work with images,
animation, and sound - can be used to interact and control electronics
and other physical devices. Two physical computing initiatives related
to Processing will be presented: <A HREF="http://www.osmankhan.com/">Osman Khan</A>
will explore the <A HREF="http://arduino.berlios.de/">Arduino project</A>
and <A HREF="http://spd.e-rat.org/">Sean Dockray</A> 
will present the <A HREF="http://wiring.org.co/">Wiring project</A>. In addition,
some recent Arduino/Wiring projects developed at UCLA will be
demonstrated.<BR>

The event will begin with an introduction by <A HREF="http://reas.com">Casey Reas</A>
, co-initiator of the <A HREF="http://processing.org">Processing project</A>. Casey will introduce the project that was
co-developed with <A HREF="http://benfry.com">Ben Fry</A> from ideas explored in
the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab and recently
won a Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica 2005.<BR>

Osman Khan will be giving a presentation and lecture on Arduino
http://arduino.berlios.de/. Arduino is an open-source physical
computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development
environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino
can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be
connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing,
MaxMSP). The Arduino board is inexpensive and easily assembled by
hand. This provides a cheap and easy way to get started learning how
to assemble circuits. Osman Khan is an artist interested in using
technology to construct engines that help create artifacts for social
criticism and aesthetic expression. His work explores certain themes
to see how technology fabricates as well as subverts our understanding
of identity, communication, and public space through interactive
installations and site-specific interventions. His work has been shown
at Ars Electronica, Linz, Austria, Beyond Media Festival, Florence,
Italy; UC Santa Barbara, USA; LALALA Westweek, Pacific Design Center
in Los Angeles, USA; nano, LACMALab, Los Angeles, USA; telic gallery,
Los Angeles, USA; Dangerous Curve, Los Angeles, USA; bank, Los
Angeles, USA. Osman received his MFA from UCLA's Department of Design
| Media Arts.<BR>

Sean Dockray will be giving an overview and demonstration of the
Wiring platform http://wiring.org.co/. Wiring is a physical
computing platform with a sophisticated I/O board and a development
environment utilizing a Processing style language for programming
microcontrollers. Sean Dockray is an artist whose practice follows
from research into social systems and events. He is a founder of the
Los Angeles chapter of the Institute for Advanced Architecture; a
producer of Building Sound, an internet radio program about
architecture; and has worked with the Center for Land Use
Interpretation on their Land Use Database. Dockray received a BSE from
Princeton University in Civil Engineering and Architecture in 1999 and
completed coursework towards an MFA in Critical Studies from the
California Institute of the Arts in 2002. His individual and
collaborative work has been shown at the Telic Gallery (Los Angeles),
the Turtle Bay Museum (Redding), Basekamp Gallery (Philadelphia), Oni
Gallery (Boston), Marcuse Gallery (San Diego), Contemporary Artists
Center (North Adams), LeRoy Neiman Gallery (New York), and the
Storefront for Art and Architecture (New York).<BR>

<BR>
Arduino/Wiring Projects from UCLA<BR>
<BR>
This portion of the event will include quick presentations of some of
the best projects built in a recent class by Sean Dockray and a
workshop by Tom Igoe of NYU. These demos involve the creation of
electronic instruments build for performance and small boxes imbued
with behavior. All projects sense some aspect of its environment (e.g.
light, distance, orientation, touch) and have a physical output (e.g.
light, sound, motion). Each project uses an Arduino or Wiring boards
as a software control system for mapping the input to the output. A
variety of sensors have been explored: orientation, tilt,
acceleration, light, sound, IR and sonar distance, RFID, etc. A
variety of different actuators have been used: solenoid, step, DC, and
servo.<BR>

After a short hiatus, Dorkbot-socal is revived with a new 
home, a new time, and new structure - and a new twist for January: we're trying out a free-form "open hack" concept for the entire event. To get more hands-on-hacking going on, every 2nd
month (starting in January) will be a "bring your project and work on it"
event, featuring semi-regular appearances by the guru Tom Jennings <A

pervasive electronic gaming. These devices range in size from 
about that of a tiny laptop, to the size of a small book. We 
then configure these portable mobile devices with a GPS sensor 
that measure your location in the real world, and orientation 
sensors that can tell precisely where you're looking. This 
combination makes for designs that represent a true innovation 
in game play. Vis-a-Vis Games is an enterprise of the Mobile

After much planning, Dorkbotsocal will finally be held in Santa 
Barbara.  DORKBOTSOCAL7  will take place on Friday, March 4th at 8pm 
at UCSB.  In conjunction with the "Calculating Images" conference at 
UCSB (<http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/calculate.html>), Marcos Novak will 
open the evening with a talk entitled "Transvergent Beauty: 
Computation and Alloaesthetics".  For those of you who haven't heard 
Marcos talk, you're in for a treat.  After that, we'll reconvene in 
another room (Arts 2220) to hear August Black and Dan Overholt 
present.  August Black has worked on numerous international 
projects, and will share some of his work with us.  Dan Overholt 
will close off the evening with a presentation entitled 
"Re-inventing the Orchestra: HCI in music performance" in which he 
will demonstrate some captivating gestural interfaces for electronic 
music.  If you're interested in architecture or audio, this event is 
for you: come on out and see beautiful Santa Barbara.<BR>

<A HREF="http://www.centrifuge.org/">http://www.centrifuge.org/</A><BR>
<BR>
Marcos Novak is a pioneer in the field of virtual architecture. In 
the mid 90s, his contribution to International architectural 
discourse was further expanded by the coining and definition of the 
term "Transarchitectures". His approach: "we conceive 
algorithmically (morphogenesis); we model numerically (rapid 
prototyping); we build robotically (new tectonics); we inhabit 
interactively (intelligent space); we telecommunicate instantly 
(pantopicon); we are informed immersively (liquid architectures); we 
socialise nonlocally (nonlocal public domain); we evert virtuality 
(transarchitectures)." He has also posited a new "Soft Babylon," a 
theoretical stance which posits that our digitized architectural 
palette is causing us to create a wired Situationist city, while we 
struggle with some of the massive paradigm shifts that our era will 
and must face. Whilst articulating highly fluent theory, he has 
practiced, producing beautiful ethereal architectures that flux and 
shimmer as his algorithms run their designed logics. He received the 
Masters of Architecture at Ohio State university in 1983. Since that 
time he has taught at Ohio State, University of Texas Austin, the 
Architecture program at UCLA, the Digital Media program at UCLA, Art 
Center College of Art & design, Pasadena. He has published, lectured 
and exhibited his work internationally.  <BR>

<A HREF="http://aug.ment.org/">http://aug.ment.org/</A><BR>
<BR>
August Black has an awful habit of calling himself an artist. 
Previously, this has meant making marks on paper and later on 
canvas. Now, this means almost anything concerning material, 
concept, and form. His research is based in the overlap of media 
(both digital and analogue, electronic and mechanical), focusing 
mostly on the kinds of audiences that are created and induced by 
emerging conventions of observation and involvement.  He works in 
radio, television, software, networks, comics, text, and projected 
sound/light. Collaborating with others on various free radio 
stations in Austria, he's devised a technique for performing live 
radio on a shoestring budget from networked locations outside of the 
studio, transforming the location at hand into material and subject 
for conceptual play.  He is currently an IGERT research fellow at 
the University of California Santa Barbara.<BR>

Dan Overholt (UCSB): "Re-inventing the Orchestra: HCI in music 
performance"<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/~dano/">http://www.create.ucsb.edu/~dano/</A><BR>
<BR>
In music composition and performance, it has always been important 
to use a variety of instruments in order to create interesting sonic 
environments. Historically this led to the development of many 
different acoustic instruments, but musicians have increasingly been 
composing and performing with computers - today, various audio 
synthesis techniques are used to generate sound; these synthesis 
techniques can be viewed as modern corollaries to the different 
orchestral instruments. Moreover, given the flexibility of these 
synthesis algorithms, today's virtual instruments are capable of a 
much wider range of sound generation than their acoustic 
counterparts. However the interfaces used to control these new 
sounds are predominantly based on historic instruments such as the 
piano (MIDI keyboards), or simply use a standard computer 
keyboard/mouse. While such standardized approaches are useful in 
some situations, they limit the range of musical expression that our 
new orchestra of synthesis techniques potentially offers. Instead of 
losing much of the expressiveness and live performance capabilities 
of acoustic music, we should extend our methods of sonic control to 
a more intricate level by developing gestural interfaces for 
electronic music. I have developed several new interfaces with this 
goal in mind, and will explain the ideas behind their creation and 
demonstrate how they work.<BR>

Neil Kearns: he supposedly has an RV that he's modified to be driven by
sitting on the roof, and it's outfitted with a bunch of video monitors
playing an obscure synchronized mix of images.  We'll put on our 
jackets,
head outside, and go inside the darned thing.<BR>

Come on out, bring your own "refreshments", egg nog and a couple of 
friends - this will be a mind-engaging and memorable event!<BR>

Paula Poole and Brett Stalbaum will talk about doing arbitrary mapping          
things with GPS, in their incarnation as painterflat.net. Paula and             
Brett spend as much time as possible in the Great Basin, performing             
their vocational pursuits as artists, as well at their avocational              
interests in archeology, geography, geology, natural history, and               
low-impact, minimalist camping. The Great Basin provides the immense            
scale, subjective context, and open access to remote space that 
combines        
the above interests into a multiplicity of possible outcomes. The goal          
is to conceptually explore in the spaces between disciplines of 
interest        
to us - for example between database and painting. Brett will also talk         
about the other major collaboration he is involved with, C5 
corporation,        
their stunning recent discovery of the actual physical location(s) of           
the Great Wall of California, (the speculative "other" of the Great 
Wall

TRACK-THE-TRACKERS is a network installation consisting with mobile
components. The project makes use of existing personal technologies in
conjunction with GPS infrastructure to provide participants with an 
audible (not
a visual) experience of the proliferation of video surveillance in the 
urban
public sphere. The mobile unit, a bag containing a laptop, 
GPS-receiver,
earphones, and a generic mouse is taken on a walk through the city. The 
sound in
the headphones changes whenever the participant enters the vicinity of 
a
surveillance camera. This effect is not automatic but created by other
participants who are adding new locations to the existing database. The
technology is documented with the intention of inspiring others to 
build similar
psychogeographic systems.<br>

Annina Ruest is a Swiss media artist currently based in San Diego. Most 
of her
artistic activity so far has taken place within the field of software

TEMP is a software based network environment for any software capable 
of tcp or udp socket communication. TEMP is made for people utilizing 
computers and similar devices as a tool for their expression. Where 
most 
software is developed for specific processes, TEMP interconnects these 
environments, and enables collaborations between artists, scientists, 
or 
researchers from different disciplines without insisting on one 
particular 
software environment. Time shouldn't be spent on solving technical 
issues 
but rather on finding communication models to explore the possibilities 
of 
interactions and interconnections amongst nature, people, and devices.<br>

Andreas Schlegel is a computational designer interested in collecting 
data, sensing spaces, exploring communication processes in the fields 
of networks. He received a diploma in communications design from Merz

LIGHT ATTACK is a media artwork, as well as a social experiment, which 
takes 
place the urban sphere of Los Angeles. While driving through the city, 
an 
animated virtual character is projected onto the cityscape of L.A. 
exploring 
three places "to go" and three places "not to go", according to the 
popular 
Lonely Planet travel guide. Light Attack elaborates the concept of the 
"moving 
moving" image in the stereotyped neighborhoods of Hollywood, Beverly 
Hills, 
Santa Monica, Downtown, Watts, and Compton. The virtual character, 
projected 
from a moving vehicle onto the city facades, reacts to the 
architectural context, 
and interacts with passers-by while "walking" through the city. The 
character's 
actions are condensed in a gallery installation, reflecting projection 
as an 
emergent ubiquitous medium. The piece raises questions about property 
and privacy. 
How public is public space? How projection, as a medium, changing the 
environment 
in which we live?<br>

This - I think - will be one of the most exciting DORKBOTSOCALS yet: we're 
meeting at Flash Film Works in Hollywood, a motion picture special effects 
house.  Dan Novy, a dorkbotter and FFW employee, will give us a quick tour 
of the facilities.  The first presenter will be Spot Draves (down from San 
Fransisco) who will be presenting his acclaimed "Electric Sheep".  Next, 
Doug Goodwin from CalArts will present "Reactive System"; last but not 
least, we'll catch Ryan Schoelerman, fresh from performing his "Autonomous 
Radiobodies" system on the streets of Los Angeles.<br>

<br>
Bring all your friends and beer: prepare to see some great work in an 
interesting venue.<br>

<br>
Dan Novy will be presenting a quick "nutz and boltz" walk through of the 
process of creating visual effects for motion pictures. Topics will 
include 3D model creation and integration into onset footage, image based 
lighting, massive distributed rendering, and network issues that arise 
from moving immense data sets on a daily basis. Facility tour 
included.<br>

<br>
Electric Sheep is a distributed screen-saver that harnesses idle computers 
into a render farm with the purpose of animating and evolving artificial 
life-forms.  Each clip of animation has a genetic code, and the collective 
voting of users determines its fitness.  In the next version a P2P network 
distributes the bandwidth of sharing the video and votes.<br>
<br>
Spot will show a video documentary explaining the project and answer 
questions, then play some new "best of" sheep.<br>

Spot (AKA Scott Draves) is a software artist schooled in computer science 
and mathematics and living in the San Francisco Bay Area that produces 
visuals by writing software.<br>

The Reactive System is a framework designed to support real-time 
interactive art-works involving synthetic actors.  RS promotes the 
simulation of conversation over limited-bandwidth media including email, 
sms texting, IRC chats, faxes, threaded discussions, voicemail and 
webcams.  RS operates either synchronously or asunchronously, and 
maintains emotional state over extended periods of interaction.  RS is 
modular, so it may facilitate communication with any number of actors and 
people,  Ultimately it should be possible to assemble a cast of characters 
each with their own emotional state and conversational abilities.  The 
system should be able to interact with any number of peer applications 
including other instances of the RS.  Equally important is the development 
of a persisten emotion engine that could respond to the quality of 
interaction.<br>

Autonomous Radiobodies is a public art performance/installation that 
involves people wearing or carrying units equipped with a Radio Graffiti 
Device for creating localized radiophonic art/graffiti spaces. The intent 
of this project is to create an immediate radio art/public voice space for 
listeners by using the mainstream FM broadcast as a background "canvas" 
and disrupting it on a localized level with spontaneous short radio burst 
interruptions.<br>

323-468-8855 after 7pm.  Flash Film Works has two buildings on the 
property and we'll be presenting in the UPSTAIRS of the BACK building.  
There should be plenty of parking on the street, and people should walk up 
the drive way between the two buildings and come into the BACK building.

Laparoscopic surgery is a surgical specialty which involves operating
through
small incisions. The internal organs are seen by inserting a video
laparoscope
through one of the small incisions. The delicate coordination required for
laparoscopic surgery and the high cost of failure demand standardized
training
systems and metrics for laparocopic skills. The ISM60 is an interactive

module for laparoscopic skill training and measurement. The module is a
rotating sensor carousel with several coordination and knot tying tests. 
It
provides
a video overlay with task data, error count, and score. PC software allows
administrative monitoring and logging of these tasks. The ISM60 is 
designed
to be mounted in the RealSim LTS2000, an enclosure that simulates the
abdomen.<br>
