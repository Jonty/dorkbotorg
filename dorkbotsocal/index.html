Scenting the antiseptic institution
For over eight years Brian Goeltzenleuchter has designed olfactory-based art installations which disseminate scent in one of the most antiseptic of institutions, the art museum. While designing evocative smells might appear to be the olfactory artist's primary creative challenge, Brian's presentation will point to another challenge that is often overlooked for its technical and creative potential: The device itself used to transmit the scent. Using as case studies four recent art projects, Brian's Dorkbot presentation will consider a variety of scent distribution devices - from lower tech to higher tech - and offer technical, poetic and conceptual justification for his choice of each. The presentation will conclude with a description of a forthcoming project, and a challenge to the audience to identify solutions to the challenges it poses in distributing scent.

Soyoung lives in Los Angeles, California, USA. She graduated in 2011 from the University of Washington with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. She has a post-disciplinary practice that includes sculpture, performance, video, photography, and technology. Soyoung enjoys the intersection of media and science, and her work uses new technologies to create connections between viewers and ideas.  Using found advertisements and a readymade discount robotic teddy bear, "THE 50% OFF BALLET" calls attention toward underlying attitudes which frame Valentine's Day. This piece places the viewer in a position where they are provided messaging from media ranging from musical typical of the holiday, to what could be considered perverse.

Come meet the LA Biohackers and find out more about some of the biotech projects going on in their lab!
<br>
<br>
Speakers to include...<br>
<br>
<b>Keoni Gandall</b><br>
Keoni will be talking about how he is bootstrapping a synthetic
bacteria using the common laboratory bacteria Bacillus subtilus.
Currently there is no easy method for creating a new organism even if
you have the ability to synthesize a new genome from scratch.  A
method Keoni is working on allows for a new genome to first be
integrated into a host genome, then split off during cell division
to create two daughter cells - 1 with the host genome and 1 with the
new genome.  This method will have great use in synthetic biology.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sophia Hewitt</b><br>
<br>
Sophia will be talking about her research on using
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a compound found in green tea as an
anti-tumor treatment.  In some types of cancer the cancer cells repair
their telomeres so the cells effectively don't age, allowing the tumor
to grow perpetually.  Sophia is testing whether EGCG can inhibit this
telomere repair mechanism and allow for treated cells to age.  She is
usingthe  model organism called Tetrahymena thermophila which is an
excellent test bed for studies on telomere length.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cory Tobin</b><br>
<br>
Cory will be talking about his work on creating plants that make their own
fertilizer.  He is studying an extremophile bacteria that makes it's
own ammonia (fertilizer) using water and nitrogen gas from the
atmosphere.  By understanding the mechanism this bacteria uses, he hopes
to create plants and algae capable of synthesizing their own ammonia,
negating the need to apply fertilizer to the soil.

>Dorkbot SoCal is a monthly meeting of artists 
(sound/image/movement/whatever), designers, engineers, 
students and other interested parties from the  Los Angeles / Southern California area 
who 
are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the broadest sense of 
the 
term.)
<p>
The purpose of Dorkbot SoCal is to:

<ul>
<li> give artists/programmers/engineers an opportunity for informal peer 
review
<li> establish a forum for the presentation of new 
art works/technology/software/hardware
<li> help establish relationships and foster collaboration between people 
with various backgrounds and interests
<li> give us all a chance to see the cool things that our neighbors are 
working on
</ul>
<p>
Imaginary presentation topics:
<p>

<ul>
<li> a demo of the new motion tracking software you're writing
<li> playing a video you made
<li> an explanation of how you hacked your game boy to get it to make cool 
bleeping noises
<li> trouble shooting/brainstorming your remote-controlled sandwich making 
robot
<li> bringing in some dancers you're working with and having them 
demonstrate 
the interface used in your new mind-control ballet
<li> discussing your approach to electronic sculpture

</ul>
Demos of commercial software are not appropriate, unless you wrote the 
software or you are making it do something particularly novel or 
interesting. On the other hand, presenting a piece that was created using 
commercial software is fine.
<p>
Dorkbot SoCal meetings are free and open to the public. Space at 
some 
events may be limited, so you are encouraged to come a bit early.<p>

Dorkbot SoCal meetings have taken place in different locations around 
Southern California.  Currently, we're going to be meeting at Machine Project gallery in Echo Park (Los Angeles) for the next while.  Meeting locations and directions will be posted at 
this website about one week before the event, 
<a href="http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsocal/">http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsocal/</a>

Dorkbot SoCal meetings are largely informal, but to save everyone 
time and energy a certain amount of planning will go into each meeting. 
The current structure for presentation/demo events is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>brief intros, announcements, administrative details
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q & a
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q & a
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q & a
<li>final comments/debate/etc.
</ul>

<p>
In other words, each meeting is about 2 hours long and features three 
presentations.
<p>
On the other hand, "open hack" events will be more free-form:
just bring your stuff, work on it (or show it) and get feedback.<BR>

You are encouraged to provide most of the resources needed for your 
presentation. However, some  equipment may be available for your use. 
Please 
be prepared to give your presentation with only the resources you bring 
with 
you.  Available resources may - by some chance - include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> a Mac OS X laptop, PowerPoint
<li> a data projector (but works best with Macs)
<li> a wireless broadband network connection
<li> a small mixer and powered speakers
</ul>

<p>
Q: I want to present something at Dorkbot SoCal. is my project
appropriate? what styles/genres/scenes does Dorkbot SoCal 
represent?
<br>

A: Dorkbot SoCal is (or tries to be) totally neutral in regard to
style/genre/scene. An emphasis on the creative use of electricty is all 
that is required. See above for some examples of appropriate topics.
<p>
Q: What if I just want an audience for my new piece?
<br>
A: Short performances/demos are fine. However Dorkbot SoCal isn't 
really a
good venue for presenting things like full performances or long-form 
recorded
sound/video pieces. If there's enough interest we will probably organize
some more formal performances/shows at some point. For now the meetings
will be more informal chances to exchange ideas with other interested
parties.
<p>

Q: I make cold, hard, intense, machine-robot-skull-hammer music, and am 
bent on the annihilation of the human species. Can I participate in 
Dorkbot SoCal meetings?

<br>
A: Yes, of course! however, you are not allowed to kill any human species at a 
Dorkbot SoCal 
meeting.
<p>
Q: I do soft, warm, dreamy, auto-electrolysis live performance video and 
founded a local PETA chapter. Can I participate in Dorkbot SoCal 
meetings?
<br>
A: Yes.
<p>

Q: Do I have to join something to participate in Dorkbot SoCal?

<br>
A: No. Although you might, at some point, be asked to contribute to the
cash-sucking-machine.
<p>
Q: Why are Dorkbot SoCal meetings on the one day in the month i'm 
busy? 
<br>

A: Because you are too busy.
<p>
Q: Well can you change the date? How about the first Tuesday of the month?
<br>
A: Probably not. This is Southern California -- there are jammed freeways 
every day of every month filled with people that think they have somewhere 
important to go.
<p>
Q: is Dorkbot SoCal run by a university?

<br>
A: No. Dorkbot SoCal is run by the participants in 
Dorkbot SoCal 
and is coordinated by Thomas Edwards. The meetings are free and open to 
the public. The locations of our meetings have been kind  
enough to sponsor Dorkbot SoCal and to donate the use of their 
facilities. 
<p>
Q: <b>Dorkbot</b> is a stupid name.
<br>

A: "Dorkbot" was around for 4 years <A HREF="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotnyc/04.oct.2006/">in NYC</A> before Dorkbot SoCal... so I had nothing to do with this.  If you have serious concerns about this, talk to <A HREF="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/">Doug Repetto</A>.
