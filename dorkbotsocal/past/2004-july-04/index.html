<br>
We will be meeting on the patio between the KUCI FM 
(http://www.kuci.org) headquarters and the Arts Computation Engineering 
buildings at UC Irvine at noon on July 4th, 2004.  This event is 
directly adjacent to the May 2004 DORKBOT-SOCAL event location.<br>
<br>
This event will be in in "opendork" format: you are invited to bring 
audio equipment, noise-making machines, strange robots, electronic 
gear, recordings, and ideas.  We will be transmitting live to air for 
the duration of the day, and will strive to integrate your ideas and 
gear into the mix.<br>
<br>
Simultaneously, we'll also be having a BBQ: bring food and drink and be 
prepared to socialize, jam, and experiment.<br>
<br>
<br>
[ L I S T E N -  O N L I N E ]<br>
<br>
On July 4th 2004, you can listen to us live via the internet and on FM 
radio - tune in to catch the event.<br>
