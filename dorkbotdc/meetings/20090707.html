									<p class="description">Fresh from having performed in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/intangible/3645112289/sizes/o/" title="Baltimore Electronic Music Festival 2009 poster.">Baltimore Electronic Music Festival</a> Keith will talk about how he conceived of, researched and constructed a set of tubular bells from scrap galvanized pipe. He’ll also touch on some other ongoing musical construction projects. Following a Q&amp;A session, he’ll demonstrate the bells as he generally use them in performance, processed through a variety of electronic effects.</p>
									<p>About Fast Forty<br/>
									Keith calls this genre Intense Ambient: found sounds, altered electronics, scrap metal and other devices, blended to soothe and stimulate. His musical roots were developed in an industrial city (Cleveland), where he grew up in the virtual shadow of a Ford plant. He's also lived most of his years within a few blocks of railroads. His musical experiments tend to reflect these environmental influences.</p>
