Steve discussed using the GM862 Cellular Quad Band Module, manufactured by <a href="http://www.gm862.com/" target="_blank">Telit</a>, and available from <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=757" target="_blank">SparkFun Electronics</a>, in our projects.<br /><br />Steve Hernandez is an engineer working in areas of telecom that he'd rather not discuss with you, but only because he doesn't like the hassle of having to dispose of your body afterwards.</p>
