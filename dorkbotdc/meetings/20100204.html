		<span class="title">How to Fit as Many Steps as Possible Into Ideas that Started Out Really Simple</span>
		<br /><br />
		<p class="description">Working on his new project "<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/8609521" title="Glance on Vimeo">Glance</a>" allowed Andy to explore and employ a surprisingly wide variety of processes, both artistically and technically. He'll be sharing his obstacles and the solutions they generated.</p>
		<p>Andy Holtin is a master builder, professor of art and a sculptor working with computer and microcontroller based performative sculpture whose work was recently featured on the <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/01/andy_holtins_glance.html" title="Make: Online : Andy Holtin's "Glance"">Make Blog</a>. He received his MFA from Virginia Commonwealth Universityâ€™s Sculpture and Exended Media program. His work uses technological systems to create perfomative objects and interactive installations, incorporating an exploratory range of materials and processes. Holtin currently works as half of the collaborative duo CausalityLabs, pursuing projects that explore mechanism as metaphor for human experience and perception.</p>
		<p>His work has been exhibited internationally at locations including Galerie35, Berlin, Germany; Vienna's Museums Quartier; Museo Antropologico y de Arte Contemporaneo, Ecuador; Museo Universitario Arte Contemporaneo, Mexico City; Planetario Alfa Science and Culture Museum, Mexico; and nationally at museums, galleries, and universities from New York to Portland to Florida. Holtin is currently Assistant Professor of Sculpture and coordinator of the Sculpture area at American University, addressing traditional media as well as installation formats, kinetic and interactive systems, and digital audio and video.</p>
