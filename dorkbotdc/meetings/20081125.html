			<span class="presenter">Alden Hart</span><strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong><span class="title">Practical Microcontroller LED Designs - lessons and gotchas from prototype to production</span>
			<p class="description">LED projects are a popular topic these days. This talk covers some microcontroller LED projects Alden has done ranging from at-home projects to manufactured units. Alden will have a variety of projects that should perhaps not have been attempted - such as <em>Balls on Sticks and The Low Rider Christmas</em>, <em>Silent Music Box</em>, and <em>10mi2 Lucites</em>.</p>
			<p class="description">The talk will cover practical lessons that resulted, including:
				<ul>
					<li>Color theory, transformation and perception as related to LEDs
					<li>LED driving and dimming techniques, multiplexing - and some workarounds to common problems
					<li>PIC16F917 assembly programming, optimization, and tricks. Open sourcing the control stack from these projects.
					<li>How can this all be done as cheaply as possible?
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="description">Time permitting we may also get into some of the more arcane details about circuit board design, manufacture, and assembly; surface mount at home, mechanical considerations, and other topics.</p>
			<p class="description">Alden is a hardware and software engineer who started doing gate-level design in the late '70s and has been working his way up the stack ever since...Only to fall down again a few years ago with a renewed interest in microcontrollers and electronics. His company Ten Mile Square is a small group of technology practitioners who specialize in the disciplines surrounding media and web systems.</p>
