			<span class="title">Cheaper Arduino Wifi</span>
			<p class="description">Bringing ethernet connectivity to the Arduino for around fifty dollars, Lady Ada's <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/rant/2008/02/new-kit-arduino-ethernet-xport-shield/">XPort Shield</a> has gotten people understandably excited.  But with a little elbow grease and a custom firmware, you can do even better: <strong>a $10 component</strong> can bring ethernet, wifi and a full Linux environment to your microcontroller project.  Not bad, right?  Tom Lee explained how, and showed a simple Arduino-based ambient display that uses the approach to show Metro schedule information.<br /><br />Tom is a DC web developer and technologist who contributes to <a href="http://www.dcist.com">DCist</a>, <a href="http://techdirt.com">Techdirt</a> and whatever other blogs will have him.</p>

		<p class="description">Gareth presented a "Maker Profile" on under-appreciated American rocketry pioneer Jack Parsons, based on "Darkside Rocketeer," his feature on Parsons running in <a href="http://makezine.com/13/">MAKE Volume 13</a>. <br /><br />Jack Parsons is one of the most important figures in the history of American rocketry and space development. He invented the JATO (jet-assisted take-off) motor, founded America's first rocket program, co-founded JPL and Aerotech Corporation, and created the formulations for solid rocket motors still in use today. Unfortunately, Parsons' controversial private life&#8212;as a practitioner of ceremonial magick, a follower of infamous British occultist Aleister Crowley, and as a devout hedonist&#8212;has caused many of his technical achievements to be shoved into the closet of history. Parsons' untimely death in a mysterious home lab explosion has only added to the sordid nature of his story. Gareth talked not only of Parsons, but the group of fellow amateurs and CalTech students he worked with&#8212;known as The Suicide Squad&#8212;and the amazing intellectual backdrop of Pasadena and CalTech in the 1920s and '30s.<br /><br />
