									<span class="title">Quick and Dirty Quartz Composer</span>
									<p class="description">An introduction to Apple's visual development environment combining some of the capabilities of Cocoa, Quartz 2D, Core Image, OpenGL, and QuickTime. Demos will include an audio visualizer, webcam input, MIDI control, and the integration of compositions into stand alone Cocoa applications.</p>
									<p class="description">Jack Whitsitt is an artist and an enterprise security and risk architect working in the area of National Critical Cyber Infrastructure Protection. He enjoys closely interweaving traditional fine art and technology wherever possible and has previously spoken at Dorkbot on the subject of his mixed-reality Second Life efforts in 2007.  He finds <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/QuartzComposer/qc_intro/qc_intro.html" title="Quartz Composer Programming Guide: Introduction to Quartz Composer Programming Guide">Quartz Composer</a> interesting because its visual paradigm takes some of the syntactical tedium out of quickly creating programmatic visual effects.</p>
									<p class="description">Justin Cameron is a tinkerer and business consultant working in the areas of telecom and professional security services.  His interests include audio synthesis, video art, physical computing, and presenting 'crowdsourced' art that derives its input from the deliberate and accidental participation of the audience. Justin works with Quartz Composer because of its fast development environment and similarity to audio modular synthesis environments.</p>
