		<p class="description">This was the first-ever joint meeting of Dorkbot DC and Make:DC, and the first-ever meeting of <a href="http://makedc.org/" title="makedc.org" target="_blank">Make:DC</a>!<br /><br />
			During this meeting, we built LED cubes <em>based on</em> on the one from the Make blog <strong>but</strong> we're improved on it by using an open-source Arduino microcontroller instead of an ATtiny2313V.<br /><br />
			Participants brought as many of the listed items as they could:
			<ul><strong>TOOLS:</strong>
				<li>soldering iron and stand</li>
				<li>solder</li>
				<li>wire cutters*</li>
				<li>wire strippers</li>
				<li>needle nose pliers</li>
				<li>insulating tape (black electrical tape works well) and/or shrink-fit tubing</li>
			</ul>
			<ul><strong>PARTS</strong>:<br />
			
				<li>Arduino or compatible unit</li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://store.makezine.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MKARDIE&amp;Show=ExtInfo">Diecimila PLUS USB board (fully assembled)</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/">Boarduino (solderless Arduino clone)</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://store.makezine.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MKBBARD">Bare Bones Arduino Kit (unassembled)</a><br /><em>Please have your Arduino assembled by the meeting, if you buy it unassembled.</em></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=arduino&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Arduinos and other related components.</a></li>
					</ul>
				<li>47 Ohm resistor (yellow purple brown striped)</li>
				<li>27 LEDs</li>
				<li>Wire (or paper clips work pretty well for this type of application)</li>
				<li>Case for it all to go in. (you might be able to repurpose something as a case for more of a 'prototype' look. E.g., the Boarduino and a 9V battery should fit in a big Altoids case.)</li>
				<li>9VDC @ min 500mA power supply (e.g., wall-wart transformer)</li>
			</ul></p>
		<p class="description">Some kits were pre-ordered at a discount.<br /><br />
			Experts were on-hand to help novices with soldering techniques and other instruction.<em> Those under 18 had to have <strong>full-time</strong> supervision by at least one legal guardian.</em> [Photo from <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/" target="_blank">Make: Blog</a>]
