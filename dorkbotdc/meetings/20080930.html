		<p class="description"> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=xtracooltech" title="YouTube - xtracooltech's Channel">Lightglove</a> is a &ldquo;virtual controller&rdquo; technology worn underneath the wrist that optically senses hand shape and tracks position with motion sensors in real time. Not only does it allow the user to control elements in virtual space, but the interface itself is virtual since it is a non-contact optical sensing platform that moves untethered with the hand(s). The host system emulates any hand-input device e.g. mouse, joystick, on-screen keyboard or virtual reality glove. The benefits of this unique technology include ergonomics, instant availability on the wrist and gesture-based control. We will discuss the advantages of Lightglove technology and provide a live demonstration to illustrate operation and the fine degree of sensitivity the controller offers.</p>

		<p class="description">Functional programming languages are used by discriminating hackers around the world because of their power and elegance.  But for those discriminating hackers that want to target low-power hobbyist-class platforms such as ARM and XScale based systems, or even smaller systems, a quandary exists: popular functional language compilers such as the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and the MLton Standard ML compiler are very big, complex, and employ large run-time libraries.  Recompiling the run-time libraries for new platforms is difficult.  As an alternative, this talk presents an open source functional programming language compiler that generates pure C code -- code expressly designed to be suitable for compilation and execution on these hobbyist-class platforms.  This eliminates the quandary that those discriminating hackers face when targeting small, low power hobbyist-class platforms for building <strong>REDACTED</strong> and <strong>REDACTED</strong>.
