		<span class="title">Where's the next checkpoint?!</span>
		<br /><br />
		<p class="description">In their seventh generation, videogames are nearing the level of cultural significance previously achieved by books, albums, and (static) artwork. And yet, they are battling for legitimacy in much the same way cinema did until the 1960s. And just like film, original videogame materials may be lost forever due to neglect and the industry's intense focus on the here-and-now.  In this talk, Rachel, doctoral student at the iSchool, will discuss her findings from a preliminary survey of videogame industry (and player community) preservation and records management practices.</p>
		<p>Rachel Donahue is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland's <a href="http://mith.umd.edu" title="Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities">iSchool</a>, researching the preservation of complex, interactive digital objects.  She received a BA in English and Illustration from Juniata College in 2004, and an MLS with a specialization in archival science  from UMD in 2009. Rachel is a Research Assistant at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, currently supporting  the <a href="http://pvw.illinois.edu/pvw/" title="Preserving Virtual Worlds">Preserving Virtual Worlds</a> and Computer Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections projects. Additionally, she supports the research and communications activities of the National Archives and Records Administration's Center for Advanced Systems and Technology.</p>
