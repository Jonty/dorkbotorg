		<p class="description">Gareth Branwyn is a contributing editor at MAKE and part of the MAKE: Blog team. He also recently became an editor at Make: Books, O'Reilly's new MAKE/CRAFT-related imprint. His first title in that role is <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/059651428X" title="Amazon.com: The Best of MAKE (Make): Mark Frauenfelder,Gareth Branwyn: Books" target="_blank">The Best of MAKE</a>, a collection of 75 favorite projects from the first ten volumes. Gareth is "Cyborg-in-Chief" of the personal-tech website Street Tech and a contributor to Wired.com. When not working, he likes to pass the time contemplating his navel (it's an "innie"), dog paddling the media spew, and generally soaking up as much life experience as possible.
<br /><br />Gareth will report on his recent trip to Maker Faire Austin and share his thoughts on the new DIY movement/"handy heyday" and what it means in the greater scheme of things (at least as far as he's concerned).
