				<td><font size="-1">The reality we perceive is not a flow of flat images as a digital camera or video camera would output, but consciousness &quot;of things.&quot; This project attempts to represent that consciousness. This is an interactive video work based on a Real-Time body tracker inspired from MIT Pfinder and uses latest GPU-based technologies.<br>

				<td><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.music.emory.edu/COMPUTER/KAMhome.html">KAM: Ki Ageng Mangir</a> is a Javanese shadow play for shadow puppeteer and Western and Javanese gamelan musicians with interactive video and audio projections. It is based on the play Mangir by Indonesian author and political dissident, Pramoedya Ananta Toer.  Shadow puppets and music are able to interact with the use of several computer-based hardware-software programs: Kyma Interactive Composition System and Isadora Video Processing System. In combining traditional Javanese and contemporary Western art forms, KAM attempts to mirror the cyclical nature of current and past sociopolitical dynamics in Indonesia.  To maintain political power, Javanese rulers throughout their history have used the shadow puppet play as a symbol of royal authority. KAM provides a modern glimpse into this intriguing world of shadows and the struggle for political power.<br>
