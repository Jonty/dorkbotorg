				<td><font size="-1">Chuck+Audicle is a free cross-platform environment for writing and rewriting live music code. Once we encode a few assumptions of musical structure, we can begin making cheesy music and shaping it as it progresses. <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu">ChucK</a> was originated by Ge Wang and Perry Cook.<br>

				<td><font size="-1">Relations between us and the artificial life/intelligence created by us, represent now more than ever the human idea of what &ldquo;life&rdquo;, &ldquo;creation&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; for these two is. The Robot as a symbol of the Big Other, the Robot as the Alien, the Monster, the Golem; the Robot as a stand-in for any relationship between the categories of 'margins' and 'main', oppressed and oppressor will be my main concerns in this presentation. Not long ago I found in the web a curious discussion on the robot sensitivity. The core question was: &ldquo;Is man the one who gives feelings to the robot, OR the robot already has some?&rdquo; Although these two agendas are usually predefined by the philosophical/religious background one has, they represented the general human dream of having a personal slave and our fear that the slave sooner or later will rebel against us. Does the question about robot being sensitive is a question of fear or curiosity?</font>

Rossa&rsquo;s projects - &ldquo;Spookybots&rdquo;, &ldquo;Robo-Sapiens&rdquo;, &ldquo;Roboriada&rdquo;, &ldquo;Citizen Robot&rdquo;, and the curatorial project &quot;Defenseless and Bad&quot; are dedicated to human/machine relations and have been exhibited at L Gallery Moscow, Foundation for Art and Creative Technologies (FACT), Liverpool, Society for Art and Technology (SAT), Montreal; CMU Art Museum, Chiangmai, Thailand; National Gallery of Fine Arts and Goethe Institute, Sofia.   In 2004 together with the Russian artist Oleg Mavromatti, Rossa establishes UTRAFUTURO - an international group of artists that works in the intersection of technology, ethics and human/machine identity.
