				<td><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.gregkellum.com/">Greg Kellum</a> will discuss how to use Max to control lights and create moving light environments.  A brief description of the hardware with which one can control lights using software as well as an overview of useful objects in Max for conceptualizing and controlling movements of light.  Plus, an introduction to one such system developed in Max by Greg Kellum for controlling matrices of light bulbs with a p5 virtual reality glove.<br>

						Greg Kellum (born 1977) began learning about electronic music while working on a play whose last two acts he wanted to set to music.  He studied music (among other things) at Columbia University, and since then, he has created music and/or electronic instruments for a number of music theater productions including Schiller's Mary Stuart and Artaud's Letter from Rodez (1945).  He is currently working on a full length album, but when he is avoiding working on music, he also writes music software and develops ideas for live electronic performances.</font></td>

I begin with the attitude that drawing is a biological function of human beings, and the most rudimentary form of visual expression. The audio recording represents a <i>shadow </i>realm of mark-making. It reveals a previously unconsidered aspect of the drawing activity. It demonstrates that an individual&rsquo;s drawing<i> voice </i>is as unique as its visual counterpart. One of the research heuristics <i>Drawing Voices</i> provides is an enunciated language<i> </i>that is produced when one is drawing or writing. (continued as <a href="dongoski.pdf">PDF</a>)<br>

					<p><font size="-1">Craig Dongoski is an artist living and working in Atlanta since 1999. In 2000 he presented a fragment of a film and soundtrack he is currently involved with titled &lsquo;FROZEN WISDOM&rsquo; which was displayed at the Raymond Lawrence Gallery for the month of August 2001 in Atlanta. He recently completed a film and sound project where CNN footage from the 9-11 tragedy is merged with Orson Welles&rsquo; 1939 broadcast of &lsquo; War of the Worlds&rsquo; to produce a new fiction. Prior to teaching at GSU in the School of Art &amp; Design last semester, he had been living and working in Boston since 1991. He has been active in exhibiting in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Further involvements include organizing collaborations such as the International Print Symposium in Boston and co-curating a major exhibition and print exchange for the First Africus Biennial in Johannesburg, South Africa.&nbsp; Dongoski&rsquo;s work is a continuous and ongoing exploration into the potential of <i>new models</i> in art making.&nbsp; Dongoski was a 2004 Rockefeller Fellow nominee and his project <i>Drawing Voices </i>will be featured in the February 2005 issue of &lsquo;Art &amp; Antiques&rsquo;.</font></p>

					<p><font size="-1"><a href="http://knewt.blogspot.com/">Keith Rowell</a> will present -Knewt-, a biped robot project. Phase one of the -Knewt- project attempts to use servos and microcontrollers and machined parts to make a biped walking robot. Walking is achieved at this stage using &quot;canned&quot; animatronic routines resulting in a &quot;dumb&quot; device. Phase two will incorporate sensors that sense balance and detect obstacles, and will incorporate code that produces &quot;dynamic&quot; motion. i.e. the ability to respond to its environment.<br>
							<br>
							There is a natural divide between art and engineering. These two camps of creative people applying their skills to make &quot;things&quot; seem like similar persuits.&nbsp;But they are comming from opposite ends of the field&nbsp;philosophically. Rowell finds the ground in between to be the most fertile.<br>
