Chris Woebken: Animal Superpowers<br>
Our senses evolved to equip us with the skills necessary for survival
in the natural world. Rather than enhancing the functional aspects of
products, I am interested in designing new sensory experiences in
relation to the invisible. We know that animals have extraordinary
abilities allowing them to sense information and perceive the world
through sensory experiences far beyond anything humans will know.
I want to create a discussion about how our relationship to
natural systems might change in the future. I will demo Animal
Superpowers and also introduce an overview of my research projects
around the human-nonhuman inter-species relationship.<br>

Simon Burton: Telephone telepathy<br>

Most of us have experienced it, or think we have. The sense of knowing who
is calling, before we even answer the phone.
Is it just coincidence, or can we measure this effect?
Simon Burton will be presenting a new
public experiment starting in the US,
and discuss some of the controversy revolving around such research.
This is work being supervised by Dr. Rupert Sheldrake.<br>

Kunal Gupta & Syed Salahuddin: BUILD UR OWN BABYCASTLE<br>
Babycastles is an effort to provide a social home for the game development culture that has long been part of New York City.  As a new function of a legendary all-ages venue for Brooklyn music and other local diy-culture, Babycastles is a wall of six lovingly decorated arcade cabinets that offers a physical place to play games made by amateur and independent game developers. The arcade is open four or five nights a week, during every show at the Silent Barn. The venue throws an opening party every few weeks for a new collection of arcade games, with the game developers present, music, drinks, and plenty of opportunity to get together and love games.
We'd like to focus a little bit about how affordable this project has been, our game installation script built from the source code of AutoHotkey, the effect an arcade for local developers has on a venue and on the city, upcoming arcade spaces that we know are opening this year, and overall just encourage and help out more arcades in the city.<br>
