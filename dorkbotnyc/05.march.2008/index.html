Marie Evelyn: Analogous and similar projects<br>
Complexity Theory is not new to art or to our culture.  It migrated from computer science and 
biology to economics and art and, with the advent of the world wide web, it invaded our 
collective subconscious.  Analogous seeks to support complexity-driven art and artists playing 
under this conceptual umbrella of "Interaction Art".  Progress often occurs by metaphor and 
analogy.  So their hope is that, by bringing together people and projects irrespective of media 
and genre, they can help to enable philosophical crosstalk.  In this way, Analogous endeavors to 
serve the community as a sort of, ahem, "Santa Fe Institute" for the arts ..but without the 
millions of dollars and Nobel Prize winners.  (Although, if you have millions to share, they are 
totally agreeable.)
