Jaime Ekkens & Kristen Mukai: Big Screen Plaza<br>
Pulsing between 29th to 30th Streets at 6th Avenue, in the heart of Midtown
Manhattan, the Big Screen Plaza's 30 x 16 ft. HD-format LED screen is a new
nexus of the city's cultural life. Established in 2010, the 10,000-square foot
outdoor multimedia venue hosts major events and screenings of an eclectic mix,
ranging from cinema to sports, from the arts to fashion. BSP has hosted major
media events and has partnered with the Wine and Food Festival, The Brooklyn
Academy of Music, the New Art Dealer's Alliance, the Streaming Museum, Leaders
in Software and Art, Telegraph21 and more... The BSP is featuring Movie Nights
with an array of classic films from all genres in an urban incarnation of the
old drive-in. The Arts are well represented at the BSP, featuring the best
works by video and animation artists. We also support New York arts schools by
showcasing fine work by these emerging talents. To enhance this experience,
visitors can enjoy the sumptuous offerings of the FoodParc, BeerParc and the
sophisticated atmosphere of Bar Basque. Big Screen Plaza's ongoing aim is to
serve as a nodal point for entertainment as well as cutting-edge cultural
innovation coming out of New York and elsewhere.

Joshua Hudelson: Electronic Voice Phenomenon<br>
Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) is the name that a small community of
Americans across the U.S. give to their practice of using tape and digital
recorders to channel the voices of the dead.  For some, EVP is a means of
responding to the death of a loved one, while for others it has historical or
scientific interest.  In all cases, however, EVP speaks to a relationship
between people and recording technology, and this relationship is fraught with
matters of voice, spirit, presence, and noise.  Can EVP tell us anything about
the nature of recording technology, and what opportunities might it provide for
thinking about music composition?<br>

Gene Kogan: Explorations in generative visual art<br>
Gene Kogan will present a series of software programs which create generative
visual artworks. Simple deterministic processes drawing on concepts from
geometry, physics, and simulation are iterated many times over, amplifying
small changes in initial conditions to produce novel and often unexpected
results.<br>
