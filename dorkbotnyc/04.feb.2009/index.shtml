Benjamin Caras: CNC for artists<br>
I am an artist who has broken out of traditional creative realms and engineered a simple CNC 
machine utilized to make art that is capable of many tasks (more and more every day). In its 
current configuration it can be set up to plot on a large scale or to run a plasma cutting 
machine. Built (against advisement from professionals) from parts that are available at most 
hardware stores and capable of results that rival cnc machines that cost tens of thousands of 
dollars. All for under $750. I will also be discussing improvisational mechanics/engineering, 
a DIY / "who needs you?" approach to outsourcing digital fabrication, organic knowledge bases, 
and open source ideas and methods.<br>

Thessia Machado: synf<br>
An analog synthesizer based on a quad nand oscillator and a divider chip. Synf is a portable and 
somewhat unpredictable racket-maker in a handy package, complete with built-in amp and speaker. 
Also, some thoughts and images on a work-in-progress involving "harvested" lcd screens and more 
oscillating frequencies.<br>

Hans-Christoph Steiner: Reware
We are surrounded by gadgets, from iPods to phones to PDAs. These little black boxes are in fact 
full-fledged computers and are eminently hackable. Yet these devices are locked down to try to 
prevent you from doing anything but consuming: consuming media and consuming minutes. On top of 
that, we discard these devices at an alarming rate. Thanks to many hardcore hackers, you can now 
run the Linux kernel on many of them. We are building on top of that work to turn these devices 
into an Arduino-like platform for hacking. We are starting with Pd and Python firmwares, now 
available in alpha releases.<br>
