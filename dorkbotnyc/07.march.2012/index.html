Katherine Liberovskaya and Keiko Uenishi: "LandFilles"<br>

LandFilles is an "install-action" with live processes by o.blaat (Keiko
Uenishi) and Katherine Liberovskaya. Meant to take place over several days,
it consists in the construction of a structure/environment from recycled
materials (transparent PET bottles), with the participation of the general
public, to form instruments for multi-channel/projection audiovisual
performance. Liberovskaya is a video/media artist based in Montreal and New
York. Involved in experimental video since the 80s, she has produced
numerous videos, video installations and performances shown around the
world. Since 2001 her work focuses on collaborations with composers/sound
artists mainly in live video+sound performance. Sound art-i-vist, social
composer, and a core member of SHARE (http://share.dj), o.blaat (Keiko
Uenishi) is known for her works formed through experiments in restructuring
and analyzing one's relationship with sounds in sociological, cultural,
and/or psychological environments.<br>

Ranjit Bhatnagar: instrument-a-day<br>
Every year I spend the month of February making a new musical
instrument each day. The daily projects range in ambition and
complexity from a fully working violin to banging on garbage with a
stick.  Winds, strings, percussion, electronics, digital, analog,
fire, whatever, melodic and drone and noise instruments; hacksaws,
pointy sticks, laser cutters and 3d printers.  I'll show highlights
from five years of instrument-a-day and bring examples for people to
try out. Ranjit Bhatnagar is a sound artist creating sculptural
installations, musical instruments, and interactive compositions.  He
lives in Brooklyn, NY.<br>
