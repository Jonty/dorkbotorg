<b>Chris Korda</b>: Whorld open-source live video software<br>
Whorld is a free, open-source Windows program that offers a unique approach
to creating live digital art. Whorld generates real-time animation, but
unlike most visualizers, it's designed for performing, and includes MIDI
support and other features more commonly found in clip-based VJ programs.
Whorld animates sacred geometry, and distorts it according to parameters
that can be adjusted manually, or automated via programmable oscillators.
The result is a mesmerizing, psychedelic composition of continuously
transforming shapes. I'll explain and demonstrate Whorld's parameters,
effects and capabilities, from basic patch editing to advanced stuff like
auto-crossfading between patches and patch hybridization. You'll learn how
to make art out of geometry and oscillators, without consuming anything
except a bit of electricity. Can tools encourage shared vision and community
instead of detachment and alienation? Could Whorld rekindle popular interest
in aesthetics, and contribute to a much-needed reconciliation between art
and science? We'll see.<br>
