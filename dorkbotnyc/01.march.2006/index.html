<b>k.cain and b.crabtree</b>: almost certified<br>
<i>almost certified (grade A noise for non-discerning consumers)</i> is a mechanical sound installation 
and informative publication. a distributed network of precarious egg-tapping robots. each unit, individually 
amplified, features a select unconventional egg. calculated sequences emerge, conducted by beautifully 
rendered software on a resurrected mainframe (a sweet mac LC3). "we seek and impart knowledge, addressing 
alarming practices and trends in the egg industry. by promoting social consciousness we can live better 
through decentralization."<br>

<b>Chris Korda</b>: Whorld open-source live video software<br>
Whorld is a free, open-source Windows program that offers a unique approach
to creating live digital art. Whorld generates real-time animation, but
unlike most visualizers, it's designed for performing, and includes MIDI
support and other features more commonly found in clip-based VJ programs.
Whorld animates sacred geometry, and distorts it according to parameters
that can be adjusted manually, or automated via programmable oscillators.
The result is a mesmerizing, psychedelic composition of continuously
transforming shapes. I'll explain and demonstrate Whorld's parameters,
effects and capabilities, from basic patch editing to advanced stuff like
auto-crossfading between patches and patch hybridization. You'll learn how
to make art out of geometry and oscillators, without consuming anything
except a bit of electricity. Can tools encourage shared vision and community
instead of detachment and alienation? Could Whorld rekindle popular interest
in aesthetics, and contribute to a much-needed reconciliation between art
and science? We'll see.<br>

<b>the botmatrix</b>: Heddatron<br>
For the past year and a half The Botmatrix collaborated with The Les Freres Corbusier theater company on their latest play Heddatron: An adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's classic play Hedda Gabler complete with 5 robots.   We will discuss our experiences collaborating, designing and building 5 robots for the three week theatrical run. Time permitting we will also discuss some of our other projects/events such as the annual Robot Parade!  Expect lots of bot goodness.<br>
