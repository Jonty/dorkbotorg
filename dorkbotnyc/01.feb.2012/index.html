Josh Silverman: Pretty Extreme<br>

The Synplode Project was started as a means of investigating a novel approach
to group-based interactive systems. With elements of generative music and
visuals, Synplode provides an opportunity for meaningful simultaneous
interaction with large groups of participants. At dorkbot, Pretty Extreme
founder Josh Silverman will be ruminating on the concepts of "generative,"
"meaningful simultaneous interaction" and "large." Josh will also be discussing
other ongoing development projects at Pretty Extreme, and the challenges of
pushing technology to do new things that he's already promised it can do.<br>

Pinar Yoldas: Enhanced Organ Systems<br>
Pinar Yoldas is a Turkish artist, designer, neuro-enthusiast. (She
simply loves hijacking your nervous system in the name of art.) Building on her
varied background in architecture, interface design and
science, her work is a series of multi-modal experiments on the human
sensorium. Lately, she has been designing synthetic biological systems
as a living critique of our society.  Pinar has a BArch from METU, MS
from ITU, MA from Istanbul Bilgi University and an MFA from UCLA.
Currently she is pursuing her PhD at Duke University.
At Dorkbot NYC, she will introduce SuperMammal&trade;, NeoLabium&trade;
and MegaMale&trade; three enhanced organ systems designed to tackle with
the future of  pleasure and pain at a sensory level.<br>

Arno Klein:  The Ellora Daily Photo<br>
Arno Klein has taken a photograph of his 7-year-old daughter's face every day
of her life.  To study the development of her facial features, he has marked the
thousands of images with landmarks, aligned the images to each other with these
landmarks, created a time-lapse movie, and is working on image processing
algorithms borrowed from brain imaging in a quest to automate chronological
sorting of these images.  After providing some context, he will show a 3-minute
movie of the first 5 years of her life (at almost 10 days/second), and present
current work and future plans for this unique dataset.<br>
