Sean Montgomery: Vital Threads Biofeedback Apparel<br>
I began developing Vital Threads biofeedback apparel to open fashion to dynamic new forms of personal expression and interpersonal communication. I will debut three prototype pieces from my Vital Threads collection: heart-on shirt, truth wristband, and thinking cap. The heart-on shirt projects rhythmic pulses of light synchronized with the wearer's heart beat. The truth wristband displays the wearer's galvanic skin response as a continuous metric of his/her psycho-emotional response to the environment. The thinking cap measures brain activity from the wearer's scalp EEG and projects changes in neuronal synchrony on modular light arrays.<br>

Brian House: TXTML<br>
TeXT message Markup Language and its software interpreter comprise a (beta!) DIY system for creating interactive text-messaging applications. It is the result of experimenting with text-messaging as a narrative and performative medium and designing story-systems for non-traditional contexts like Berlin's S-Bahn and the Statue of Liberty. TXTML also reflects my philosophical interest in inventing formal languages to reflect one's artistic biases. At the moment, TXTML is being used for "The Wrench", an art project that re-imagines Primo Levi's novel The Monkey's Wrench as a text-message exchange with an automated character.<br>

NYCResistor: Barbot<br>
NYCResistor is a new Brooklyn-based hacker collective that generates
an endless stream of amusing objects.  One of our current projects is
the second iteration of our Barbot, a rack-mounted system designed to
ensure that anywhere that data is served, tasty beverages can be as
well.  We'll also talk a bit about our new space, some of our other
projects, and why a marshmallow cooked over a 15,000V electric arc
just tastes better.<br>
