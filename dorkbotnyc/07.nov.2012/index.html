Chris Kaczmarek: Alpha-Bit<br>
Over the past twelve years research activities in sound art and DIY audio
circuits have led Kaczmarek to teach a course in Aural Electronics and form an
evolving group of visual, performance and sound artists called Alpha-Bit which
uses scratch built electronic and circuit bent instruments in improvised
performances.  As Kaczmarek has explored these subjects and participated in DIY
culture, he has amassed a fair collection of experiences and battery powered
boxes that make odd electronic sounds.  From the basic structure of an
oscillator and the value of listening to noise music, Kaczmarek brings forward
not only ideas about what we are doing in these fields, but also some
hypotheses about why it is important. <br>

On Structure: twisTisch<br>
On Structure (Jessie Marino & Natacha Diels) is a sound-centric performance duo. The New York based ensemble
uses improvised and composed sounds {and the fluctuation of these sounds} to
brew transferable art pieces which may ravage the realms of the performer,
audience or space itself. In "twisTisch" a formal narrative of childish rituals
gets pulled apart and reassembled rendering confused emotional states, rhythmic
schizophrenia, and near tantrums while a specially designed "magical table top"
illuminates and augments the minutia of a glitchy and dangerous game of patty
cake.<br>

Langdon C Crawford: new controllers<br>
I am currently making and performing with new controllers.  For a few years now
I have enjoyed making music and even performing with electronics or computers,
but I have not enjoyed sitting at a computer while on stage.  I don't believe it
makes sense to use the same physical vocabulary to type this description to
perform an aggressive electronic dance beat. Instead I seek to use gestures
inspired or informed by dance and instrumental performance to control the music.
Additionally I wish to perform without the need for visual feedback from the
computer, as I find it too easy to get caught staring at the computer instead of
paying attention to other performers or the audience.  My inspirations range
from The Hands by Michel Waisvisz to "the drop" by contemporary EDM producers.<br>
