Plotters!
Chiplotle.org

Pen plotters in use long before computers
XY plotter - like turtle graphics!
Examples of 1960's plotter art (not a lot- plotters expensive in early days)
Cheap inkjets killed plotters mostly

Plotters have more interesting physical interactions with paper, ink
mixing, etc compared to inkjet raster
Can use variety of pens, pencils, papers...

Types: xy plotter, x-plotter with paper feed,

They've collected 15 plotters so far
Go on eBay before they get to be valuable collector items!

Vertical x-y is handy for less desk space eg dxy1300
Paper-movers are faster than xy
Xy handles wider variety of materials

Can get expired old pens on eBay, sometimes they stll work or you can refill em

Get serial connection, avoid HP-IB or parallel connection

Most Roland and hp plotters take interchangable standard pens, can buy
adapters- pens are disposable but can be refilled


Recommended search on eBay :
Pen plotter -vinyl -ceramic -fiber -holder -pencil -lead -disposable
-black -blue -red -green

Old plotters come with ancient driver software
Chiplotle is contemporary plotter controk software - libraries for hpgl
Hpgl is simple text based control lang but more pleasant to use
chiplotle in python
Free & open source, knows lots of plotters, handles limited buffer sizes etc
Represents plotter as object w methods

Demo of interactive plotting in python command line

Can convert from other vector formats  like eps or pass thru a raw hpgl file

Typewriter simulator! Plotters usually have built-in fonts
