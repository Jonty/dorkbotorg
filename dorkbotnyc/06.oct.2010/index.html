Jack Toolin: The C5 Landscape Initiative<br>
The Landscape Initiative considers the navigation, representation, and perception of landscape in light of growing technological mediation brought about by locative media. It is composed of four projects: Analogous Landscape, Other Path, Perfect View, and The C5 Media Player, and was produced by the art collaborative C5, formerly based in Silicon Valley. GPS, satellite imaging, computer graphics, etc. allow us to conceptualize our experience of landscape in complex ways. The four projects composing the Landscape Initiative apply navigating and mapping technologies, data mining, photography and video, as well as sculpture to conduct and convey the projects' underlying concepts. Questions explored include: How do locative media affect the phenomenological experience of the natural environment? In what ways do these technologies enhance the experience of nature? Can landscape-as-data be sublime?<br>

Melanie Crean: The Shape of Change<br>
The Shape of Change is a series of projects that analyze the capacity of
speech to produce personal and political change.  The project time frame
began with the election of Barack Obama, and will run in conjunction with
his proposed period of demilitarization from Iraq. The series of four
projects consider the depth of the relationship between language and
political agency at different stages of life. The first project looks at a
baby acquiring agency through language; the second investigates a young boy
comprehending and describing war for the first time, the third involves
college students from Iraq & the US exploring issues of power and
cultural bias in their educational systems; and the final project observes
how adults from Iraq & the US express the desire for political change over
time. By comparing the projects as they evolve simultaneously, one can
examine the relationship between language and change from a range of
personal and political perspectives, through the lens of different forms of
media.<br>

Caitlin Berrigan: Traces<br>
I will be presenting on the medical, material and software meanderings
in the making of "Traces," a renewable sculpture of my disembodied
kidney, cast in frozen spit. Every two hours a new frozen organ is
refreshed, cupped in my hands cast in aluminum, only to melt and drip
away. The last ends of the kidney slip onto the floor, and a wet mess
remains. I materialized the kidney by laboriously tracing the
topography of my internal organ from a 3D MRI, consisting of hundreds
of sequential medical images. I conceived of Traces as a poetic
deterritorialization of medical biotechnologies, organs without bodies
and fleshy displacements. It calls attention to the alienability of
body parts and the vast global industry that sustains the promise of
an infinitely repairable body.<br>
