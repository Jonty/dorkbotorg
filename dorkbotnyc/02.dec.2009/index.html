Cynthia Lawson Jaramillo: The Moments Between Still & Moving<br>
Photography is traditionally considered a medium that pauses time.  In her recent artwork, 
Lawson Jaramillo positions photography as a media art by developing bodies of work that use 
it to extend and challenge our traditional notions of space and time.  At dorkbot-nyc she 
will present her digitally and physically layered photographs and will focus on her recent 
experiments with extremely slow moving videos and coded generative image-based works. <br>

Arno Klein: Brain Labeling<br>
I will present examples of how and why people label brain images, from painstaking, 
manual labeling of human brain MRI data to fully automated labeling algorithms.  I will 
also give a preview of a new NIH-funded project that will manually label 1,000 brain 
images and borrow a strategy from face recognition to serve as the brains underlying a 
new fully automated brain labeling software program called Mindboggle.<br>
