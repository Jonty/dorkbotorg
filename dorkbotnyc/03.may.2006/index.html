<br>
<b>Dan Iglesia</b>: Generative Processes<br>
Three audio/video projects that use generative processes to yield unexpected
results unpolluted by the human hand. "Temporide" does a pixel-by-pixel
delay on a video, showing many time lapses simultaneously. Spectral
splicing, morphing, and reconstitution creates new audio based out of what
you feed it. And "Ghost Jockey" generates a continuous stream of mashup
audio and video.<br>

<b>LoVid</b>: Kiss Blink Sync Vessel<br>
The interdisciplinary artist duo LoVid will present different permutations of their AV synthesizer 
<em>Kiss Blink Sync Vessel</em>. LoVid has been incorporating this handmade modular analog audio/video 
synth into sculptural instruments, installations, and media objects. LoVid will also give a short performance 
with their most recent wearable version of KBSV, <em>Coat of Embrace</em>, which allows them to break out family 
style while getting middle ages real old school.<br>

<b>Jason Van Anden</b>: Intelligent Designer<br>
What do you get when you combine probablistic programming paradigms, computers with feelings and a 
room full of the gifted and talented?  Artist/Technologist/Robot Maker Jason Van Anden will 
demonstrate IntelligentDesigner (beta) - software that enables pretty much anyone to control things 
in an uncontrollable way.  ID was originally invented to enable improvisational behavior 
simulating human emotional mechanics between his life-size emotive robots Neil and Iona. In its 
current incarnation, ID can be used to easily create rich multilayered living music from samples, 
with many more esoteric applications coming down the pike.  Jason hopes to get feedback of ID beta 
from the Dorkbot ranks and recruit some early adopters to start making things with it before its 
official release, next Fall.
