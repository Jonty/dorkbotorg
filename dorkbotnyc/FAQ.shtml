<h2>hypothetical Q & A</h2>
<p>
q: i want to present something at <b>dorkbot-nyc</b>. is my project
appropriate? what styles/genres/scenes does <b>dorkbot-nyc</b> represent?
<p>
a: dorkboy-nyc is (or tries to be) totally neutral in regard to
style/genre/scene. an emphasis on the creative use of electricty is all

for some examples of appropriate topics.
<p>
q: what if i just want an audience for my new piece?

really a good venue for presenting things like full performances or long-form recorded
sound/video pieces. 
<p>
