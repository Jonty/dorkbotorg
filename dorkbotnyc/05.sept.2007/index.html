Christian Croft & Kate Hartman: Energy Harvesting Dérive<br>
The Energy Harvesting Dérive combines new modes of pedestrian movement
with alternative energy research goals. The project hacks the recently
popular Heelys roller sneaker to transform it into a platform for
generating electricity from human motion. Electricity harvested from
rolling powers electronics on the shoes that deliver random directions
for pedestrians to follow.

Michael J. Dory: Concrete Crickets<br>
Graffiti is one of the most powerful and most personal displays in the urban experience, and can 
be used to make statements, tag territory, spread messages — urban markup language in practice. 
However, the output is nearly always visual in nature, making this experience one-dimensional. 
Furthermore, rarely does the work have a brain of its own, and is usually incapable of reacting 
to anybody observing it. Concrete Crickets was created to address this deficit, creating small 
devices that will be aware 
of passers-by as well as other units of their kind. Each unit consists of a sound generator, amp, 
speaker and sensory system, and is housed in camouflage appropriate to the streets of the city — 
soda cans, cigarette packs, and the like.
