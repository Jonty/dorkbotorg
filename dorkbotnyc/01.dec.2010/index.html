Brian Whitman: Cut Bait<br>
I've been making software and hardware to make music instead of actually making music for ten years and I blame dorkbot. "Scared Straight" style, I'll show you the things I presented exactly ten years ago at the very first dorkbot-nyc and then do some group therapy to try to convince at least one of you to put away the italian microcontrollers with python interpreters running Conway's Game of Creative Death and go make something beautiful that your mother will love. She misses you, you know. <br>

R. Luke DuBois: A More Perfect Union<br>
A More Perfect Union looks at American self-identity through the
medium of online dating services and the metaphor of the decenniel
U.S. Census.  Using data from over twenty online dating sites, the
work is organized according to the same heuristics as the U.S. Census,
sorting online dating profiles by Congressional District and
subjecting the imagery and text to statistical analysis.  Online
dating forces us to engage in a vulnerable act of articulating our
self-identity in a semi-public forum for the express purpose of being
wanted, and to read a thoughtful dating profile or view a profile
photo is to view the precarious expression of someone else's desires.
The work contains several parts, which will be presented along with
some ten-year-old software called Jitter, or something.<br>

Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus: LoVid<br>
Before there was LoVid there was Viduo and before that there was Ladies and Gentlemen, Mark Your Doors.  It's been so long we forgot how to get to The Lazy I (Tali even forgot what and where The Lazy I is).  But we still have the wood Penguin from 
<a href="http://www.carrboro.com/clyde/clydefest.html" class="link">Clyde Jones</a> who predicted the birth of our children.  In honor of the occasion, we'll mix the VHS tape we showed at our first dorkbot with some other time-capsule faves (if we can find another VHS deck????)  We'll also VJ requests if you bring them on VHS, so let's get busy home-video0.2 style.<br>
