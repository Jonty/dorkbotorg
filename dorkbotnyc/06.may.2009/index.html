justin downs: how to be creative not making art, and how to make art creatively not be itself.<br>
The projects i have typically worked on have been large scale art ventures 
(engineering design/fabrication of the Carbon Arc Lamp for the Starn Twins 2003 and Play the 
Building for David Byrne 2005,2008, 2009 two examples). Recently I have found avenues of working 
which allow for interesting projects that have functional utility. The last project was building 
a solar powered tree house in the Kenyan Maasai land. The current one is developing with the 
Wave Farm a semi intelligent solar powered mesh network, which will hopefully translate into 
tracking collars and techniques, for african wildlife.<br>

Conrad Shawcross: Slow Arc III<br>
British sculptor and Location One international fellow creates multimedia kinetic sculptures 
that explore the artist's interest in philosophy, science and the mysterious structures of the 
universe. He will present a new work which features a halogen light moving along an articulated 
arm inside a mesh cube and some of his earlier work.<br>

Graham Smith: Social Network--A Digital Painting<br>
I have 413 Facebook friends and in one week I saw more then 100 of them in RL. I wanted to 
create a work of art about virtual friends so to do that I visited them in person. I got a 
picture of me with lost friends, childhood buddies, ex-girlfriends, family, and people from 
high school I didn't talk to. I asked them about their RL friends, asked for a physical 
souvenir, and took their pulse to be used for a 'digital painting' of lightning bugs. The 
'painting' is a wall mounted laptop running a looped program.<br>
