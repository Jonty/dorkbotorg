Erik Sanner:  Paintings that Move, Spring Planting, and How to Enjoy Traffic Cones<br>
Why make art when every day we encounter strikingly beautiful, impenetrable objects of infinite 
interpretation?  The aesthetic practice of traffic cone viewing is as rewarding as visiting a 
gallery or museum. However, by simultaneously engaging in traffic cone appreciation and 
collaborative artmaking, I believe we can each experience a unique "hey!" moment.<br>

Daniela Kostova & Olivia Robinson: Waste to Work<br>
Waste to Work explores the transformation of labor into electric power, using sweat as the link. 
Sweat is the perfect medium: it is an electrolyte that can be used to make galvanic batteries - 
"waste" that can be harvested from our labors - and remains an extremely personal commodity that 
holds our scent, essential salts, fats, pheromones. This project has multiple phases: building 
sweat batteries and sweat harvesting suits. <br>

Dwayne Johnson: Race to Witch Mountain<br>
For years, stories have circulated about a secret place in the middle of the Nevada desert, 
known for unexplained phenomena and strange sightings. It is called Witch Mountain, and when 
a Las Vegas cab driver (Dwayne Johnson) finds two teens with supernatural powers in his cab, 
he suddenly finds himself in the middle of an adventure he can't explain. When they discover 
that the only chance to save the world lies in unraveling the secrets of Witch Mountain, the 
race begins, as the government, mobsters and even extraterrestrials try to stop them.<br>

Breck Baldwin and Splinter: The Towel<br>
The Towel is a scratch built model airplane consisting of foam, trash, $100 worth of motor/prop/rc 
gear etc and 3 hours building time. It flies great and its primary goal is to channel everyone's 
inner 8 year old. It also serves as the foundation for an excellent night flier (to be 
demonstrated), aerial video vehicle and has excellent repairability and crash tolerance.<br>
