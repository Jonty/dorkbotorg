Ben Dierckx: Perceived perception<br>
I am making a series of works that try to evoke the idea of awareness of one's
own perception. Through playful installations I try to let the public
experience their own point of view in relation to that from a camera, which
films the same space they are in. Creating a mental space between your sensory
perceptions and your consciousness of it is an ancient spiritual practice.
During this talk I'd like to investigate the relation between the electronic
and interactive arts and a possible spiritual "message". I will present my work
as an example and also a curatorial project called "Only the spirits are
awake".<br>

Derek + Mira Hunter: 65 Cameras and an Electric Pulse<br>
Derek and Mira Hunter have collaborated on a series of projects that utilize
their custom 360-degree bullet time camera to explore the fleeting nature of
transformation by arresting and reanimating time. Their latest experiment,
"Time Piece" features a series of gas explosions.<br>

Emmanuel Ferrand: A monocord, doing strange things with electricity:
Harmonics, feedback, bifurcations, chaos.<br>
The monocord (just a simple vibrating string) is, since Pythagoras, a universal
paradigm in music theory. When interfaced with an elementary electro-mechanical
contraption, it may shift towards a strange harmonic behavior... This is a
variation on a theme by the American composer Alvin Lucier. I will quickly
review the historical context, and I will try to show the artistic potential of
such physico-mathematical phenomena (I will stay away from the math
technicalities).<br>
