31 Down: Pay-Phone Theater<br>
represented by Mirit Tal and Shannon Sindelar
31 Down is a theater company that uses radio and network technologies as the backbone for 
their storytelling in performances and installations. 31 Down has provided a TRIXBOX server 
(based on Asterisk) for free103point9: transmission arts. Transmission Artists with 
free103point9 now have access to an open source PBX for use in their artwork. Mirit Tal and 
Shannon Sindelar, of 31 Down, will introduce the use of this server in their upcoming 
theater projects, including the subway pay-phone mystery installation, Canal Street Station, 
opening this March.

Brad Borevitz: The State of the Union<br>
Lamenting the triumph of iconicity over rhetoricity in political speech,
Brad Borevitz created the State of the Union project to consider if evidence
for this assertion exists in the language of the the yearly address which
stands as a controlled sample over the course of U.S. history. The website
provides searchable access to the corpus of all the State of the Union
addresses from 1790 to 2007, and uses visualization software which allows a
user to explore how specific words gain and lose prominence over time. State
of the Union focuses on the relationship between individual addresses as
compared to the entire collection of addresses, highlighting what is
different about each document. From this information, users are invited to
try and understand the connection between politics and language -- between
the state we are in, and the language which names it and calls it into
being.

Tianna Kennedy<br>
Tianna's artistic endeavors are collaborative explorations of human/information interaction 
with an emphasis on the transmission of affect. Though her work often takes shape via sound 
recording, web-streaming, and radio technologies, her focus inevitably returns to the people 
involved in the process(es). For her presentation at dorkbot, Tianna will talk about the 
paradoxical role of nostalgia in the avant-garde of sound technology. Along the way she'll 
touch on edison's gramophone, Sir Oliver Lodge's Etheric experiments, and her collaborator, 
Tarikh Korula's own recent archaeoacoustic stylus, which is supposed to retrieve latent 
ambient historical sound trapped in objects at the moment of their production.
