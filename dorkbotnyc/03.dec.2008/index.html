Fang-Yu Lin: Political Science 101<br>
Political Science 101: A Crash Course in Civil Discourse on Political Blogs is a net art 
installation that constantly scans and monitors hundreds of political blogs for headlines, 
keywords and trends. The "learnings" are presented as slides that are generated in real-time, 
using textbook style charts and graphs. A hacked slide projector projects these virtual slides 
to the screen in a simulated classroom setting. Hence, the class is a study of blogs as a 
political medium, and an appraisal of its traits and uses.<br>

Alicia Gibb: Bug Labs<br>
Bug Labs is a new kind of technology company, enabling a new generation of engineers to tap their 
creativity and build any type of device they want, without having to solder, learn solid state 
electronics, or go to China. Bug Labs envisions a future where CE stands for Community Electronics, 
the term "mashups" applies equally to hardware as it does to Web services, and entrepreneurs can 
appeal to numerous markets by inventing "The Long Tail" of devices.  We believe everybody is an 
inventor at heart, so we've developed a platform for users to create and forever modify their 
favorite gadget, allowing for ultimate customization and use.<br>

Jeremy Rotsztain: Media Impressionism<br>
Media Impressionism is just one possible term for the practice of remixing cinematic imagery using 
well known practices from painting (such as collage,  pointillism, and action painting), but using 
software-based tools. In this dorkbotty presentation, I'll discuss a few of my recent video art 
and computational imaging projects and share my working process.<br>
