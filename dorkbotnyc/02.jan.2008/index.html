Paul Davies: The Trouble of Interactivity<br>
As a sculptor I have been attracted to the deep engagements that interactivity offers. My practice 
is not one of inward contemplation and self reflection but rather an active examination of current 
social and political events and currents. Interactivity offers the artist the opportunity to create 
a rich dialog with the public. Interactivity also poses great challenges to the artist. The 
challenges of fabrication, cost, and robustness are ever present. How can an artist make an 
interactive sculpture that 'lasts' more than 10 minutes into opening night? In the presentation I 
will show how interactivity has evolved in my work and how my quest for robust interactivity has 
shaped my choices. Afterwards there will be a discussion of success and failure stories. Paul 
Davies is a sculptor whose work often includes interactive elements. He has shown internationally 
at numerous galleries and museums over the past 15 years.

Jessica Thompson: Wearable Sound Projects<br>
Jessica Thompson's studio practice involves the creation of wearable sound projects that explore 
social interactions within public space. Using elements of game-playing and performance, her work 
attempts to create collaborative situations with the audience where the integrity of the artwork 
is entirely determined by willing participants.  She is best known for her project called 
SOUNDBIKE, a mobile sound piece that uses motion-based mini-generators mounted to an ordinary 
bicycle to broadcast the sound of laughter as the bike is pedaled. At dorkbot Thompson will 
discuss two recent projects, "Give It Up" (a networked breakdance battle) and "Public Sound 
Project: Bike Hack + Soundride" (bicycle-mounted noisemakers).

Jeff Snyder: New Electronic Music Instruments<br>
Jeff Snyder has been developing some electronic instruments for the past year or so, and he'll be 
showing them off. Plus, he may even demonstrate them and warm your heart with their angelic 
sounds.
