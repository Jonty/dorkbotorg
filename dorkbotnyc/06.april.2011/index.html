Dustin Grella: Animation Hotline<br>
Animation Hotline is a series of daily animations where I use messages left on
my voicemail for content.  In a day and age when most of the newspapers have
moved from print to the internet, I'd like to do the same for the funny pages.
Leave me a message before the dorkbot session and I'll try to animate it.  Use
the keyword "dorkbot" somewhere in the message, so I know to bring it in to
screen that night.  Animation Hotline +1 212-683-2490<br>

Joelle Bitton: Hide & Seek<br>
Joelle Bitton recently realized that most of her work dealt with showing and
hiding inner thoughts, fantasies, dreams, personal geographies. All themes
that particularly fit the interactive use of interfaces. She's therefore keen
to share her findings by showing - and hiding - some of her
extroverted/secretive work.<br>

Ed Bear and Lea Bertucci: ExiTrip<br>
ExiTrip is a project by Artist/Engineer team Lea Bertucci and Ed Bear and
sponsored by Free103point9. As is, this outmoded iPod accessory only functions
with a single generation of iPod Nano, which is no longer manufactured. At 40¢
each on Ebay, the low price creates unprecedented distribution opportunities
for a low power transmitter and encourages end-user experimentation. We have
hacked the iTrip to function without necessity of an iPod, vastly increasing
its usefulness as a development platform for artists and designers. Since
September of 2010, we have distributed these hacked devices to artists of
different disciplines and are documenting their work for a forthcoming book.
How can we, as artists, thinkers, hackers and designers break the cycle of
electronic waste that is perpetuated by planned obsolescence and bad design?<br>
