<b>Eyebeam OpenLab</b>: An overview<br>
James Powderly and Limor Fried will give an overview of the new Eyebeam OpenLab. The Eyebeam OpenLab is a home for 
artists, engineers and hackers pioneering open source creativity. The first initiative of its kind, the lab is 
focused entirely on incubating experimental technologies and media that 
directly enrich the public domain. With funding from the MacArthur Foundation and others, Eyebeam has awarded 
fellowships to a talented, interdisciplinary group of OpenLab fellows who work in a new facility equipped with a 
laser cutter, 3D printer, workstations, web servers, and electronics workbenches. These fellows are already 
generating ideas and building new projects, extending the innovative work of Eyebeam R&D. The Eyebeam OpenLab is 
dedicated to public domain R&D. All our work is distributed under open licenses that allow other artists, 
hackers, and engineers to remix our work, contribute to our projects, and build on top of our efforts. 
Specifically, our code is released under GPL, our content is distributed under Creative Commons, and our 
hardware is released with DIY instructions.<br>
