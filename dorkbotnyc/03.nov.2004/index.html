<b>Matt Hall and John Watkinson</b>: Cell Phone Drum Machine<br>
A software drum machine is linked to a mobile phone via infrared. The 
phone relays SMS messages it receives to the drum machine's software. 
Users can send simple commands in SMS messages from their own phones. The 
result is a drum machine that is programmed interactively by the 
"audience" with their cellphones.<br>

<b>Claire Corey</b>: Digital Paintings<br>
Claire will present her digital paintings including an animation which
shows the progression of one of her works from 2002. This hybrid medium
questions both what is expected from works made with a computer as well as
what constitutes painting.
