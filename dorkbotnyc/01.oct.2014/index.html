Chris Korda: ChordEase<br>
ChordEase is a new instrument that makes it easier to play music with complicated chords. No matter what the
chords are, you can play as if they were all in the key of C. You don't need to play sharps or flats, because
ChordEase automatically adds them for you. Though ChordEase is intended for jazz, it could be useful for any
type of music that modulates frequently. ChordEase alters your notes in real time in order to make them
harmonically correct, while preserving their rhythm and dynamics. By delegating rapid music theory calculations
to ChordEase, you gain freedom to concentrate on other aspects of musical performance. ChordEase isn't a
physical instrument, it's a free (open source) software that uses artificial intelligence to enhance ordinary
MIDI instruments, so that they can be approached in a radically new way. It's especially useful to people who
approach music rhythmically, because it can translate rhythmic input into harmonic and melodic output.<br>
