Gaelen Hadlett: Electric Home Ec<br>
While lending a hand at a couple local elementary schools, I work with kids on all sorts of 
projects involving engineering, science, and programming mixed in with everyday arts and 
crafts.  I'll share highlights and missteps of past projects and the kids' responses to the 
advanced subject matter.<br>

Hye Yeon Nam: The Sound of Kiss<br>
The Sound of Kiss facilitates an amorous ambience in which couples
digitize their love while kissing. One wears a headset and the other's
tongue is affixed to a magnet. When they kiss, the magnet and the
electro-magnetic sensor interact to create spontaneous music. The
musical composition depends on how far one's tongue is away from the
other's lips/tongue and their style of action.<br>

Ben Woodeson: The Health and safety Violations
Trained in Glasgow, Scotland, Ben Woodeson now lives in London, England. His practice revolves 
around absurd and quietly confrontational sculptures; the works set out to challenge the viewer 
and the exhibiting institution in a playful kind of art chicken. Since December 2008 he has been 
working on a new series of "deliberately dangerous" works entitled "The Health and safety 
Violations" and as part of Location One's Virtual Residency programme he has been collaborating 
with the artist Ursula Endleicher, they have never met but will spend the last week before the 
exhibition opens on 9/9 finalizing works together. He has shown throughout Europe, Canada, and 
America and he has an upcoming solo show at Electrohype in Malmo, Sweden.<br>
