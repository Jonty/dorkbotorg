<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Steve Baldwin</b><p>
Inside the Digital Dumpster: Reflections on 10 Years of Cybergarbage
<p>
The World Wide Web will, in November of 2003, be exactly 10 years old. In 
this short talk, I will talk about the issues that obtain in terms of 
trying to preserve the collective digital cultural heritage of this era by 
focussing on examples from my collection of 1,000 defunct web sites. 
Illustrations of historical milestones in mass-deployed Web graphics 
technology, including server push, GIF89 animations, frames, and 
naturally, the wild and crazy business models that are representative of 
the "dotcom implosion" will also be shown. I would also make reference to 
notable Web History projects, including the Internet Archive.

<b>John F. Simon, Jr.</b>
<p>
John F. Simon, Jr. is an artist who uses programming language as an 
activated extension of written language. His software programs are 
displayed on the web and also on wall-mounted LCD screens.  His software 
compositions emerge from a process of considering computer coding as a 
kind of creative writing.  Simon will discuss the creation of his software 
and how he arrives at the hardware for his artworks by repurposing Apple 
laptop computers.

<b>Tristan Perich</b>
<p>
CubeScreen, 3-D fiber optic display
<p>
I will talk about my recent work piece CubeScreen, which exists as a 
three-dimensional computer display, analogous to a very-low resolution 
monitor in 3D, composed of fiber-optic cable. The piece, which routes 
light received at one end of the fiber, to a pixel array spread throughout 
a 3-foot cube, is very tactile, and I will discuss the construction and 
mechanism behind its function. CubeScreeen will be on display.
