			<h2>Notes On 20th April Meeting</h2>
			<h4>April 21st, 2010<!-- by anachrocomputer --> &middot; <a href="http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotbristol/?p=176#comments">No Comments</a></h4>
			<div class="entry">
				<p> Some notes on yesterday evening&#8217;s Dorkbot Bristol meeting, for those who could not attend.</p>
<p>Ale Fernandez kindly took charge of the meeting in place of David Henshall, who&#8217;s stranded overseas by the volcanic ash cloud.</p>
<p>Rachel Carney started the evening off with the good news that our application for funding has been successful. This means that we have money available to make use of an otherwise vacant shop-front. There are some restrictions on the location of the shop, but we&#8217;re getting on with the search for a suitable one. Rachel also mentioned <a href="http://day.scratch.mit.edu/" title="Scratch Day" target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/day.scratch.mit.edu/?ref=http_//dorkbot.org/dorkbotbristol/');">Scratch Day</a>, which is on 22nd May this year, celebrating the Scratch programming language from MIT. It&#8217;s probably too soon to get anything ready for the shop-front, though. Rachel reminded us that this year is Dorkbot&#8217;s 10th anniversary, and it would be nice to make some contribution to that.</p>
<p>Richard Sewell mentioned our invitation to an art show under the Cumberland Basin road flyovers. It&#8217;s called Offerings To The Gods Of Speed, and takes place on the 19th of June.</p>
<p>I (John Honniball) did a demonstration of my work-in-progress on the idea of sending digital data by means of sound. This idea came from the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/dv/dv.html" title="Digital Voices" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/www.ics.uci.edu/_lopes/dv/dv.html?ref=http_//dorkbot.org/dorkbotbristol/');">Digital Voices</a> project, based at the University of California at Irvine. That project aims to find ways for mobile computers to communicate using sounds that are both pleasing to the human ear and practical for data transfer. Some examples of sounds that the Digital Voices group are exploring are the R2-D2 robot sounds of Star Wars, synthetic bird song and synthetic cricket chirps. My interest was in the apparent complexity of the program used to decode the sounds, using a technique of DSP (Digital Signal Processing) called convolution. Convolution entails performing many multiply and add operations on digital data acquired from an analog source. My expectation was that a small, inexpensive computer such as the Arduino would be too slow to do such a CPU-intensive task. I was completely wrong, because my test program could comfortably detect eight separate audio tones in under 5milliseconds, much less than the 32ms that it took to acquire the audio data.</p>
<p>Richard Sewell had a much more complete demo of the Digital Voices work, with two Android mobile phones communicating using  audible sounds. He had taken the original source code (in Java) and run it on the Google Android phones. He used the faster of the two  phones to do the decoding of the signal, which is the more complex task. He was able to demonstrate sending short text messages from  one phone to the other, using audio. This opened up a discussion on what the messages could be used for, how they might be broadcast, and what other types of computer could be used to receive them. We had all sorts of suggestions, including using the sounds as short-range audio beacons for positioning. Most people were in favour of making sounds in the style of The Clangers.</p>
<p>In last month&#8217;s Dorkbot, Richard Sewell showed us some parts that he&#8217;d designed and milled for a robotic walking mechanism. This month, he brought the complete radio-controlled crab-like <a href="http://mechanicalspider.com/" title="Mechanical Spider" target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/mechanicalspider.com/?ref=http_//dorkbot.org/dorkbotbristol/');">walking robot</a>. It has two motors, one on each side of the chassis, each driving  the legs on that side. In the middle is the radio control receiver and the battery pack. The leg mechanism converts the rotation of the motors mechanically into straight-line motion of the feet.</p>
<p>There was a short break for refreshments and more playing with Richard&#8217;s walking robot. I took the opportunity to look at some videos of delta robots, which are a novel type of robot arm. Commercial examples include the ABB FlexPicker and the Adept Quattro.</p>
<p>Anton Bowers showed us his methods for making PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) at home. He begins with an idea for a circuit, and  develops that into a circuit diagram (schematic) in the Eagle CAD (Computer Aided Design) program. Eagle runs on Mac, Windows and Linux, and as a free version that, although restricted, is quite sufficient for home use. Once the circuit is finalised, he then begins the physical layout of the PCB, using Eagle&#8217;s board design mode. The final PCB design, showing just the copper areas of the board, is then printed onto transparent acetate or tracing paper. Anton uses UV (Ultra-Violet) sensitive copper-clad PCB material, and exposes it using a UV lamp box that he made himself. It only takes 45 seconds to expose the board, through the transparent artwork. He then develops the board in a plastic tank, and etches off the copper in another tank containing ferric chloride. This tank is heated using a modified aquarium heater and agitated with an aquarium air-pump. Finally, he drills the board using re-sharpened 0.8mm drills from the PCB industry. The final boards, although single-sided, are every bit as good as professionally-made boards, and much less expensive for small quantities.</p>
<p>Finally, as an example of the PCBs that Anton makes, he brought out his LED cube. This is a three-dimensional array of red/green LEDs, in a 4&#215;4x4 cube. It&#8217;s connected to a shift register drive circuit (on another PCB), which is connected to an AVR ATMega32 microcontroller.</p>
