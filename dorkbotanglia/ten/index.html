	<a href="http://newcut.org/">The Cut</a>, New Cut, Halesworth, Suffolk IP19 8BY</p>

<p>dorkbot anglia is a regular evening of talks and conversations with &quot;people doing strange things with electricity&quot; in the East Anglian area. We are delighted to announce our tenth meeting as the guests of The Cut, Halesworth on Tuesday 19th February. Entry is free.</p>

<p><a href="http://newcut.org/">The Cut</a> is a thriving arts centre which aims to be the number one creative community hub for rural north-east Suffolk. Last year the basement space was refurbished as a Media Lab for education and training in the creative digital technologies. There are courses for business, the local community and young people.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Raven</strong> of <strong>The Cut</strong> will introduce:</p>
<ul class="lineup">
	<li><strong><a href="http://movingartseast.org.uk/?page_id=191">Pamela Harling-Challis</a></strong> a dance/digital artist who utilises her expertise in theatrical production to create performance and installations in arts and educational settings. Pamela's talk will include discussion of And on the seventh dayâ€¦ an installation of 12 films for iPods, the film Five Panels and No 5 music by Monty Adkins.</li>
	
<li><strong><a href="http://www.davidchatting.com/">David Chatting</a></strong> a thinker and a maker, who uses technology and design to explore mundane futures. David will discuss some of his most recent work, including Running Lives with Data, where he attempted to hack runners.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.billthompson.org/">Bill Thompson</a></strong> a sound and video artist, who is a self-described throwback to the 60s and enjoys breaking things to hear what they sound like. Bill's talk, Caveman Electronics, will involve his recent projects Shifting Currents and CRA/CKED for misused electronics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, "OpenDorks" (short ad-hoc slots for anyone to talk about their work)</p>
