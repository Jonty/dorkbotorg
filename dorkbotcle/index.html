REVIVAL Meeting!</strong><br>


<br>


dorkbot-cle</em> will hold it's first revival meeting on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sunday,
November 23th, 2008 at 7PM</span>. **Oops! &nbsp;So we were
perhaps a little too ambitious, trying to set up right around the
holidays. Now that it is the new year (and I can ask for specific days
off!) it is time to refocus our energies and get this group moving.
&nbsp;There are so many creative and insanly smart people in
Cleveland! Let's get organized! <br>


<br>


More information to come as
soon as it is
received! <br>


<br>


Our
first revival meeting will be very informal, mainly to judge interest,
meet the interested and to figure out which direction the people of
cleveland want to take the group. So bring ideas, dreams, contraptions,
interesting tidbits, and your voice.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


dorkbot-cleveland presents a free, informal gathering of artists,
engineers and programmers in the greater-Cleveland area, to show their
work, be inspired and create a vibrant community.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


If you would like to be informed of future meetings, please join our <a href="http://dorkbot.org/mailman/listinfo/dorkbotcle-announce">mailing
list</a>. To present at dorkbot-cleveland, please contact the
Cleveland dorkbot-cle moderator, <a href="mailto:dorkbotcle@dorkbot.org"><font color="#333333">Annie
Foster</font></a>.</p>

&nbsp;</span> <br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"> dorkbot-cle</span>
was originally started in November 2006 by Chris
Yewell of
Ingenuity Festival. &nbsp;As it happens all too often, good things
come to
pass and dorkbot-cle took a hiatus. &nbsp;A new few have decided
that it is
time to give dorkbot-cle another chance. &nbsp;We hope to continue
where
Chris left off both embracing and encouraging the growth and
collaboration between artists and engineers in the area. &nbsp;Much
thanks
to Chris for the original inspiration and website! <br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">dorkbot&nbsp;</span>the
national organization was formed by Douglas Repetto of Columbia
University's Computer Music Center. &nbsp;Great thanks to Douglas
for all of his help and to Columbia University for the web space.</p>
