                <p>DORKBOT #4 - review<br />
30 November 2005, Gaslab, TU/e</p>
<p>November 30th brought us to our 4th DorkbotEindhoven, this time moderated by Vivian vdG. We had planned to launch OpenDork for the first time alongside there project presentations, but as usual things didn&#8217;t quite turn out as expected. At the last moment one of the presenters got sick, and we were left with two presentations and an OpenDork which might not work out. However, as always, dorkbot was full of surprises and the night was wonderful.</p>

<p>We started off with a presentation by Gabriel (a.k.a &#8220;Salsaman&#8221;). Gabriel is a video artist, VJ, Free Software programmer and the main developer of LiVES (available for download at http://lives.sourceforge.net), a Free, Open Source video editing application and VJ tool. He is also one of the main people involved with designing livido (check out http://www.livido.org) a new standard for video processing plugins, which will soon be ready for release. At dorkbot Salsaman gave a demo of LiVES showing the main features of the software as well as some which are still in developemtn. A mini-workshop in LiVES and a little VJing for those in the audience. He also showed the new multitrack feature which is still under development and some of the video editing and effects tools available in the software. A few conversations started up around LiVES features and future developments, especially in relation to linking LiVES to audio tools. After the presentation a piece produced with LiVES was screened.</p>

<p>The second presentation of the night was of some of the light objects of Jos Kranen (http://www.joskranen.nl) who presented his work alongside a member of of Metatronics. Jos Kranen (Tegelen, 1977) graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in December 2004 with his project &#8220;flexilight&#8221; a flexible lighting system that consists of loose parts, so that the user can define his or her own electricity network throughout the living space. Through this project Jos wanted to combine his passion for design with his affection for electronics and also expand on his belief that the wonderful electronics invented worldwide need a bridge to the user. At dorkbot he presented both &#8220;flexilight&#8221; and a recent project &#8220;vase light.&#8221; &#8220;Vase light,&#8221; a project developed in cooperation with Frederik Molenschot (Breda, 1981, also a Design Academy graduate), was custom made for the Dutch Design Week 2005. In this case the light object uses water as its conductor and is meant to be placed in a regular vase filled with water and flowers. (Like the DIYers that we are at dorkbot we cut empty coke bottles and filled them with water.) The Vase Light provides the same amount of light we find in an ordinary 15 watt light bulb, but uses a power LED as light source. The technical part of the project was produced by Metatronics, a small company located on the TUE site. www.joskranen.nl / www.frederikmolenschot.nl / www.metatronics.nl</p>

<p>To end the night we launched OpenDork. The OpenDork concept is the dorkbot equivalent of an open-mic, which has been tried and tested at other dorkbots around the world because it offers random members of the audience or any dorks with smaller projects to present their works. The first presentation of OpenDorkEindhoven was made by poeticterror .com with a little assistance from one of the main dorkboteindhoven organizers who presented a few visualizations of math algorithms which he coded in flash action script.

                <p>DORKBOT #3 - review<br />
21 September 2005, Gaslab, TU/e</p>
<p>After a lengthy summer vacation DorkbotEindhoven returned to the Gaslab on September 21st. As at our 2nd dorkbot Maarten Pieterson of the Studium Generale moderated once again making sure that presentations didnâ€™t go overtime and asking interesting questions of the presenters. Though some last minute changes had to be made to our program the first DorkbotEindhoven of the year started off well with a lengthy and interesting program. </p>
<p>The first presenter of the night was Wilfried Hou Je Bek. Wilfried Hou Je Bek left school at 16 to become an astronaut but this turned out to be bad careermove and he founded socialfiction.org instead. Socialfiction.org is a website (obviously) dealing with psychogeography, cartography, diy urbanism, as well as the organising party behind generative psychogeographical walks, events and presentations. Right now socialfiction.org is busy running The Crystalpunk Workshop for Soft Architecture. This workshop, which will take place over a period of 3 months will evolve an empty room from nothingness into unknown states of technological enhancement. Unlike the alphabet that always knows where it is going, this workshop does not. It has an open door policy and everybody is welcomed to participate and will culminate at the Impakt Festival, taking place at the end of December in Utrecht. Wilfried presented the workshop speaking mostly about the concepts of crystals and punk, the way in which they evolve organically and create entirely new and unexpected forms. www.socialfiction.org / www.socialfiction.org/crystalpunk </p>

<p>Next up we were lucky to have a presentation from Enrike Hurtado Mendieta and Thor Magnusson of IXI software. They were close to ending their residency at the STEIM in Amsterdam and had shown their interest in making a presentation at DorkbotEindhoven, which was happy to host them. Enrike Hurtado Mendieta and Thor Magnusson are musicians and programmers who founded ixi software in year 2000. Ixi software is a collective of people (including Enrike and Thor) interested in the creation of musical instruments. Their focus is on screen based graphical user interfaces for open source audio programming languages. Both<br />
physical and virtual interfaces are of interest and on the website there are 15+ applications that can be downloaded for free. Ixi talked about the philosophy behind their work, being open-source, showed some of the Instruments available in the software, explained the history of ixi and demoed some of the features of ixi as well as some short pieces produced with it. www.ixi-software.net</p>

<p>The third presentation of the night was by Alexander Rulkens. Alexander Rulkens is a 4th year student in Industrial Design at the TU/eindhoven. His focus is constantly searching for answers to questions like:  What is the purpose of design? Why do humans have the urge to design the world around them? Why are there so many bad designs? What makes something a good design anyway? The project he presented was a Luminaire built to allow a user to play with light. Each movement the user makes in relation to the Luminaire directly influenced the light emanating from the object. One could pull, push, stretch, launch, dim or create any light one might want. Alexander took us through the process of building the Luminaire, talking first about the concept of lights, shapes of light, user interfaces and interaction and later showing us his preliminary sketches of the Luminaire, as well as talking about the actual process of building the physical object. Towards the end of the discussion he talked of his interest of somehow allowing the light made by the Luminare to interact with sound by connecting the object to a computer running a piece of software such as ixi. </p>

<p>Last, but not least came the last-minute addition of the night, a presentation by Gijs Gieskes. Gijs Gieskes is an Eindhoven-based electronic-musician, circuit-bender and instrument-maker. At DorkbotEindhoven he talked a little about his work in circuit-bending and object-modification in order to turn those objects into instruments. He spent most of his presentation showing a variety of â€˜instrumentsâ€™ such as a modified tape-recorder, a tonal-wheel, a gameboy, as well as sharing with us some diy-sketches of diy-circuits. He also demoed each of the instruments so the audience could get an idea of what they sounded like and invited the audience on stage to see each of the objects up-close. www.gieskes.nl / experimentalmusicalinstruments.gieskes.nl</p>

                <p>DORKBOT #2 - review<br />
8 June 2005, Gaslab, TU/e</p>
<p>The last DorkbotEindhoven before the summer vacation came and went. This time Maarten Pieterson of the Studium Generale acted as moderator of the night. Our 2nd DorkbotEindhoven also marked the start of a new concept, that of having exhibitions during our dorkbots. We started this off with an exhibit of technology related works by Chris Dierickx.</p>

<p>The evening began with Michiel van Overbeekâ€™s presentation of his project, â€˜Paso Robots.â€™ Michiel van Overbeek is a trained scientist, having studied at the TU/delft. He has always been interested in the relationship between art, science and technology, and since 2004 he has been working at his own studio in Dordrecht on a project about time and movement. The project is based on the Pasoâ€™s of Spain and South America during the week before Easter, the Semana Santa. This is the walk in which several men carry a big statue of the Virgin Mary through the streets of the city. Michiel presented his own project studying the â€˜Paso Carriersâ€™ </p>

<p>which has as its goal the building of a life-size Paso that can be carried through the streets independently by 4 robots (Xavier, Pepe, Juan and Carlos) that have adopted the same motion as the human Paso-carriers. While the work in progress itself was not presented, the audience got to hear about Michiel van Overbeekâ€™s past projects dealing with motion, as well as the way the work on the 4 carriers has progressed, starting with preliminary sketches, building their legs and testing them, and a preview about what is planned for the future. </p>

<p>The second series of presentations were from MAD (emergent art center). MAD emergent art center is an Eindhoven-based laboratory, platform and provider at the intersection of art, science and technology interested in issues of transparency of technology and an active collaboration between the art and technology fields. The presentation was started off by Rene Pare of MAD who gave an overview of the center, its projects and what it is interested in accomplishing. He was then followed by two artists who have produced netart projects in collaboration with MAD. First was Lutsen Stellingwerff, an Eindhoven web and graphic </p>

<p>designer with his own one-man design agency Biep en Lu. He presented the work ColorStalker, a flickr-based search-engine with colorful results. In ColorStalker the user types a word and presses search. The machines then searches the flickr photo-database for the most dominant colors representing that word and then returns 10 colored-cubes. If the user than presses on one of the cubes, words are returned based on that color, and so the search continues.</p>

<p>The second project presented was BabylonMachine created by Peter Heijens. Peter Heijens is an interdisciplinary artist focusing on visual as well as sound art. BabylonMachine explores the phenomenon of webradio, spoken word webcasts and interference. The result is a webpage with 24 webradio spoken word sources which the user can listen to simultaneously  or interact with by using some of the programmed features such as â€œBush Bingoâ€™ and the â€˜world emotion peak meter.â€™  Features of both works were presented to the audience and started off dialogs. mad.dse.nl</p>
<p>Up next was Roel Vliegen and his database-visualization software, MagnaView. Roel Vliegen is a computer science student at the TU/e and is currently finishing his masterâ€™s degree in the Visualization section of Jack van Wijk. Together with the TU/e and Erik-Jan </p>

<p>van der Linden he started developing MagnaView. Their mission was to visualize anything and everything: databases, hard-disks, even phone calls in a student house&#8230;. and: who calls who? Roel demo-ed the various ways of visualizing the data collected, in this case, based on phone calls made from a student house within a certain time-period. He showed ways of zooming in and out into the information, getting specific information about certain students, or phone numbers, costs and duration of phone calls, as well as general statistical overviews. </p>
<p>The final presentation of the night was an overview of the Demoscene by Egbert Teeselink. Egbert Teeselink was born in 1983 and is currently studying computer science at the TU/e. He has been involved in the Dutch as well as international demo scene since the â€˜90s. During his upbeat and enthusiastic presentation he gave an overview of the international as well as Dutch demo scenes and tried to tell the audience all about what a demo is by showing some of his own works as well as those made by others. As defined by those active in the DemoScene, â€˜demosâ€™ are computer generated music clips that show what kind of graphic and sound effects can really be done by using high-end computer hardware to its full potential. These clips are generated based on code programmed by those interested in making demos, who then minutely try to match visuals to sounds, and beats. www.mattcurrent.org / www.demoscene.info </p>

Dorkbot Eindhoven is part of a global movement of small, autonomous functioning organizations with a similar goal: offering artists/programmers/engineers/geeks an opportunity for informal peer review; establish a forum for the presentation of new art works/technology/software/hardware; help establish relationships and foster collaboration between people with various backgrounds and interests. It is the initiative of Art &#038; Technology Festival STRP in collaboration with Studium Generale (TU/e).</p>
<p>The first Eindhoven Dorkbot showcased a variety of projects and artists doing work with media, technology and code. Participating artists were: Koert van Mensvoort, NMN/dorkbot ghent, Danielle Roberts and Digital Art Group Maastricht. Each of these artists had a different take on using technology to present ideas related to art, aesthetics, society, or just allowing their imagination to let loose. Like any evening people poured in slowly at the beginning, but the event was quite popular with around 50 guests in the audience.</p>

<p>After a short introduction about Dorkbot and Dorkbot Eindhoven from our moderator Ruud, NMN/Dorkbot Ghent kicked off the first Eindhoven Dorkbot with their presentation. First an introduction of Dorkbot Ghent was made including its 4 year history and the vision it tries to bring to each dorkbot they organize and a second component based on the projects of NMN. NMN is a 5 year old non-profit organization that started Dorkbot Ghent, and also functions as an artist group that has been producing a variety of digital art projects involving sound and/or interactivity. Some of the projects shown involved either action script or processing code and the creation of various dynamic visuals based on web-cam feed or code-coordinates. http://www.nmn.be</p>

<p>Like any evening involving technology there were a few problems, fortunately for us solved quite quickly so the second presenter of the night was Koert Van Mensvoert. He is both a multimedia artist and a scientist and is currently acting assistant professor in the Industrial Design Department of the TU/e. With an upbeat, ironic presentation Koert showed a variety of works: Amateurs - a short film where 2 men play-fight with special effects; Bos ruikt naar Shampoo - a fragment of a film about how living in today&#8217;s media saturated society affects the way we view and analyze nature, especially in the case of children; Datafountain - a short amusing film about a project which revolved around the idea of building a water fountain where one could see the difference in the value of the yen, euro and the dollar in a visual way; Drift - short internet dance film about a project related to motion capture techniques; and lastly Active Cursor - an interactive cursour program that allows the cursor to have its own life rather than have to be under constant user control.<br />

<p>The third presenter of the night was webartist, Danielle Roberts. Originally trained as a sculptor and monument designer she has been active in new media since 1998. Her works most often use photography, scans, video, and text combined with programming and focus on the fusion of 3 equal components: the computer, the visitor and the artist, which all interact to become part of the whole. The project she presented, NuMuseum is a compilation of all of the works she has been creating on the web in the last years, allowing visitors to search through php-coded archives as well as creating entirely new works based on recycled web materials.<br />

<p>The first dorkbot ended with the presentation by three members of the Digital Art Group Maastricht. Berto Aussems, a self-taught new media artist working in the field since 1981, talked about the history of digital media in the netherlands and especially the Maastricht area, the founding of the Electronic Art Collective Limburg in the early &#8217;90s and subsequent foundation of the Digital Art Group Maastricht in 1999. He presented his own work Peristaltique which animates randomized graphics based on motion algorithms. Visual artist Andre Dezelak showed Morface, a morphing-animation film he made by choosing a variety of portraits he had painted in the 80&#8217;s and then morphing them into each other. Multimedia artist Rene Terhorst generally focuses on user interfaces that use brainwaves as input and create a virtual reality world as output. He screened a few recordings of animations that were controlled via brainwaves or that reacted to different types of brainwaves.<br />
