                <p>DORKBOT #2 - review<br />
8 June 2005, Gaslab, TU/e</p>
<p>The last DorkbotEindhoven before the summer vacation came and went. This time Maarten Pieterson of the Studium Generale acted as moderator of the night. Our 2nd DorkbotEindhoven also marked the start of a new concept, that of having exhibitions during our dorkbots. We started this off with an exhibit of technology related works by Chris Dierickx.</p>

<p>The evening began with Michiel van Overbeek’s presentation of his project, ‘Paso Robots.’ Michiel van Overbeek is a trained scientist, having studied at the TU/delft. He has always been interested in the relationship between art, science and technology, and since 2004 he has been working at his own studio in Dordrecht on a project about time and movement. The project is based on the Paso’s of Spain and South America during the week before Easter, the Semana Santa. This is the walk in which several men carry a big statue of the Virgin Mary through the streets of the city. Michiel presented his own project studying the ‘Paso Carriers’ </p>

<p>which has as its goal the building of a life-size Paso that can be carried through the streets independently by 4 robots (Xavier, Pepe, Juan and Carlos) that have adopted the same motion as the human Paso-carriers. While the work in progress itself was not presented, the audience got to hear about Michiel van Overbeek’s past projects dealing with motion, as well as the way the work on the 4 carriers has progressed, starting with preliminary sketches, building their legs and testing them, and a preview about what is planned for the future. </p>

<p>The second series of presentations were from MAD (emergent art center). MAD emergent art center is an Eindhoven-based laboratory, platform and provider at the intersection of art, science and technology interested in issues of transparency of technology and an active collaboration between the art and technology fields. The presentation was started off by Rene Pare of MAD who gave an overview of the center, its projects and what it is interested in accomplishing. He was then followed by two artists who have produced netart projects in collaboration with MAD. First was Lutsen Stellingwerff, an Eindhoven web and graphic </p>

<p>designer with his own one-man design agency Biep en Lu. He presented the work ColorStalker, a flickr-based search-engine with colorful results. In ColorStalker the user types a word and presses search. The machines then searches the flickr photo-database for the most dominant colors representing that word and then returns 10 colored-cubes. If the user than presses on one of the cubes, words are returned based on that color, and so the search continues.</p>

<p>The second project presented was BabylonMachine created by Peter Heijens. Peter Heijens is an interdisciplinary artist focusing on visual as well as sound art. BabylonMachine explores the phenomenon of webradio, spoken word webcasts and interference. The result is a webpage with 24 webradio spoken word sources which the user can listen to simultaneously  or interact with by using some of the programmed features such as “Bush Bingo’ and the ‘world emotion peak meter.’  Features of both works were presented to the audience and started off dialogs. mad.dse.nl</p>
<p>Up next was Roel Vliegen and his database-visualization software, MagnaView. Roel Vliegen is a computer science student at the TU/e and is currently finishing his master’s degree in the Visualization section of Jack van Wijk. Together with the TU/e and Erik-Jan </p>

<p>van der Linden he started developing MagnaView. Their mission was to visualize anything and everything: databases, hard-disks, even phone calls in a student house&#8230;. and: who calls who? Roel demo-ed the various ways of visualizing the data collected, in this case, based on phone calls made from a student house within a certain time-period. He showed ways of zooming in and out into the information, getting specific information about certain students, or phone numbers, costs and duration of phone calls, as well as general statistical overviews. </p>
<p>The final presentation of the night was an overview of the Demoscene by Egbert Teeselink. Egbert Teeselink was born in 1983 and is currently studying computer science at the TU/e. He has been involved in the Dutch as well as international demo scene since the ‘90s. During his upbeat and enthusiastic presentation he gave an overview of the international as well as Dutch demo scenes and tried to tell the audience all about what a demo is by showing some of his own works as well as those made by others. As defined by those active in the DemoScene, ‘demos’ are computer generated music clips that show what kind of graphic and sound effects can really be done by using high-end computer hardware to its full potential. These clips are generated based on code programmed by those interested in making demos, who then minutely try to match visuals to sounds, and beats. www.mattcurrent.org / www.demoscene.info </p>
