A lot of the Skype4Java won&#039;t work with Java 1.4 because of the &lt;enum&gt; type.  While there is an expert version of Processing for Windows that runs with the system&#039;s JRE we had to compile a version for the <a href="http://134.102.202.7/macosx.zip" >Mac.</a>. You can download the result and see if it works. Open Terminal and change into the folder. Then type sh run.sh<br /><br />We also had a short coding dojo and tried to produce a physical friend display with ten LED. You can download the code <a href="http://134.102.202.7/skype_try.zip" >here.</a> ]]></content>

		<title>First dorkbot hb meeting</title>

		<content type="text/html" mode="escaped"><![CDATA[We proudly invite you to our first dorkbot hb meeting ever!<br /><br />The meeting will take place at the 4th March at 17h at the University of Bremen (MZH 8100)<br />The topic is <br /><br />&quot;Open API - so what?&quot;<br /><br />Daniel Kalinke will present his work on the project <a href="http://klatschcup.com/" target="_blank" >Klatschcup</a>. The project was done at the K3 in Malmö with the guys from <a href="http://www.cutecircuit.com" target="_blank" >Cute Circuit</a> and is definitely worth to see. It is using Arduino, Processing and the Skype API to make interactive coffee cups. Afterwards we will try writing a little application that uses Skype and Arduino ourselves in a coding dojo.<br />]]></content>
