  <b>WHAT'S DORKBOT?</b><br>
  It all started with dorkbot-nyc ::<br>
  <br>
</font><font size="-3" face="geneva,ms sans serif,sans-serif">&quot;a monthly
meeting of artists (sound/image/movement/whatever), designers, engineers, students
and
  other interested<br>
  parties from the new york area who are involved in the creation of electronic
  art (in the broadest sense of the term.)&quot;<br>
  <br>
</font><font size="-3" face="geneva,ms sans serif,sans-serif">the purpose of dorkbot 
  is to: <br>
  <br>
  * give artists/programmers/engineers an opportunity for informal peer review 
  <br>
  * establish a forum for the presentation of new art works/technology/software/hardware 
  <br>
  * help establish relationships and foster collaboration between people with 
  various backgrounds and interests <br>
  * give us all a chance to see the cool things that our neighbors are working 
  on<br>
  <br>
  <b>NOW THERE'S DORKBOT- MUMBAI</b>!<br>
  with little if any representation of electronic art, new media art and/or alternative 
  media production, we've decided to take a stand. <br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
  OUR MISSION</b>:<br>
  to dorkbotize mumbai[kars] / bombay[ites]<br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
  IMAGINARY PRESENTATION TOPICS<br>
  </b>* a demo of 
      your new and kafkaesque BMC parody website.<br>
  * a demo of the software you're writing <br>
  * playing a video you made <br>
  * an explanation of how you hacked into the VT weighing scale machines to get 
      them to make cool bleeping noises <br>
  * trouble shooting/brainstorming your new open source fortune telling robot<br>
  * bringing in some dancers you're working with and having them demonstrate the 
      interface used in your new mind-control bharat natyam performance<br>
  * discussing your approach to electronic sculpture <br>
  <br>
  demos of commercial software are not appropriate, unless you wrote the software 
      or you are making it do something particularly novel or interesting.<br>
  on the other hand, presenting a piece that was created using commercial software 
      is fine. <br>
