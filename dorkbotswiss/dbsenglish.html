        <font size="4"><strong>what:</strong></font><br>
        <br>
        dorkbot swiss is a monthly meeting of artists (sound/image/movement/whatever), 
        designers, engineers, students and other interested parties from the new 
        york area who are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the broadest 
        sense of the term.) <br>
        <strong><br>
        the purpose of dorkbot swiss is to:</strong> <br>
        <br>
        give artists/programmers/engineers an opportunity for informal peer review<br>
        <br>
        establish a forum for the presentation of new art works/technology/software/hardware 
        <br>
        <br>
        help establish relationships and foster collaboration between people with 
        various backgrounds and interests <br>
        <br>
        give us all a chance to see the cool things that our neighbors are working 
        on<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <strong>imaginary presentation topics:</strong> <br>
        <br>
        a demo of the new motion tracking software you're writing <br>
        playing a video you made <br>
        an explanation of how you hacked your game boy to get it to make cool 
        bleeping noises <br>
        trouble shooting/brainstorming your remote-controlled sandwich making 
        robot <br>
        bringing in some dancers you're working with and having them demonstrate 
        the interface used in your new mind-control ballet <br>
        discussing your approach to electronic sculpture<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        . <br>
        demos of commercial software are not appropriate, unless you wrote the 
        software or you are making it do something particularly novel or interesting. 
        on the other hand, presenting a piece that was created using commercial 
        software is fine. <br>

        dorkbot swiss meetings are largely informal, but to save everyone time 
        and energy a certain amount of planning will go into each meeting. the 
        current structure is: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* brief intros, announcements, 
        administrative details<br>
        * 20-30 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a <br>
        * 20-30 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a <br>

        * final comments/debate/etc. <br>
        <br>
        which means that each meeting is about 2.5 hours long and features three 
        presentations. resources<br>
        you are encouraged to provide most of the resources needed for your presentation. 
        however, some dorkbot swiss equipment will be available for your use.

      <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>hypothetical 
        Q &amp; A</strong></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <br>
        <strong>q:</strong> i want to present something at dorkbot swiss. is my 
        project appropriate? what styles/genres/scenes does dorkbot swissrepresent? 
        <br>
        <strong>a:</strong> dorkboy swiss is (or tries to be) totally neutral 
        in regard to style/genre/scene. an emphasis on the creative use of electricty 
        is all that is required. see above for some examples of appropriate topics. 
        <br>
        <strong><br>
        q:</strong> what if i just want an audience for my new piece? <br>
        <strong>a: </strong>short performances/demos are fine. however dorkbot 
        swiss isn't really a good venue for presenting things like full performances 
        or long-form recorded sound/video pieces. if there's enough interest we 
        will probably organize some more formal performances/shows at some point. 
        for now the meetings will be more informal chances to exchange ideas with 
        other interested parties. <br>
        <strong><br>
        q:</strong> i make cold, hard, intense, machine-robot-skull-hammer music, 
        and am bent on the annihilation of the human species. can i participate 
        in dorkbot-nyc meetings? <br>
        <strong>a:</strong> yes, although annihilatory activity is prohibited 
        at dorkbot swiss meetings and you must leave your skull hammer at home. 
        <br>
        <strong><br>
        q:</strong> i do soft, warm, dreamy, auto-electrolysis live performance 
        video and founded a local PETA chapter. can i participate in dorkbot swiss 
        meetings? <br>
        <strong>a: </strong>yes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>q:</strong> 
        do i have to join something to participate in dorkbot swiss? <br>
        <strong>a:</strong> no. <br>
