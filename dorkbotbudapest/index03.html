Speakers:</p>

<p><b>+ Róbert Langh: Unstable Image Surfer Tool</b></p>
<p>
The vehicle is designed to execute maneuvers in virtual panoramas, while
downloading images from the Network. The way we move the LCD screen, we
can examine the details of images in connection with the keyword's domain,
and  associate new image searches to them. The position of the physical
modell is transmitted into the computer by a gyroscope, creating a new
sense of reality: the changing balance converts the dynamical force into a
virtual factor much better in our perception. Downloading the images can be
started by the touch screen, as a part of the floating LCD screen. From the
fragments of images panoramas are constructed, which the montage machine
creates on the spot.
</p>
<p>
Róbert Langh has been teaching at the Intermedia Department of the Hungarian
Academy of Fine Arts since 2000. He was an associate of the C3 Foundation
between 1998 and 2004, and a lecturer at the University of Applied Arts
between 1995 and 1998.

<p><b>+ Sota Ichikawa, Max Rheiner, Kaoru Kobata, Ákos Maróy: Corpora</b></p>
<p>Project "Corpora" is a model of intelligent processing behaviour emerging
from a collection of autonomous components. Rather than dictate the design
from the top down, only the basic components are created and allowed to
reconfigure via a framework of open inputs. This structure could be connected
to topographic parameters, weather conditions, human law, and so on.
</p>

<p>The project is presented by Ákos Maróy, founding member of nextlab and
tyrell.hungary.

<p><b>+ Balázs Beöthy, Zsolt Mesterházy, Rolland Pereszlényi: Double Bubble</b><br />
Interactive participatory arrangement
</p>
<p>Welcome on board of the Double Bubble! The next stop is Indirect
Communication. Please latch on to the input of the interface. Our colleague
will help you in placing the sensors. The measured data are among the indirect
elements of the energy household of the human body. The transmitted
energy-impulses will define the movement of the selected robotic body.
Bioanimation starts. From now on you won't have to move even your pinkie to
maintain connection. Stay here, hence of diligence, beyond attitude, all the
way till the battery supplies. Thank you for flying us!
