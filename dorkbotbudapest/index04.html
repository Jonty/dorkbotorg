Speakers:</p>

<p><b>+ Balázs Serényi: FlashFilterLab</b></p>
<p>
FlashFilterLab (FFL) is a node-based visual application for easy creation and real-time tuning of complex interactive movies. Based on Adobe's Flash technology, FFL gives a sophisticated tool to make easy use of Flash 8's video manipulating and vector rendering capabilities. 
</p>
<p>
FFL focuses mostly on media artists whether already familiar with Flash or not. No matter if you are interested in video processing, interactive art, exploring or teaching new media, or vjing, FlashFilterLab offers a tool for working in exciting new ways. However unbelievable it may sound, FFL is free of charge for every kind of use. 
</p>
<p>
FFL is an intuitive visual programming tool - a kit of reusable components, Flash units and filters - that can be "wired" together to build so-called scenes, which comprise complex visual filters, effects and interactive Flash movies. Using FFL, you create graphical flowcharts to model complex, script driven functionality. Throughout the simplicity and easy handling what the visual working environment offers and through unlimited variety of connecting the nodes, the possibilities are endless.
</p>
<p>
The main idea of FFL is to provide media artists an environment, which enables them to make use of visual-effect features of Adobe Flash 8 available through Actionscript 2.0 - without any need of programming. But FFL focuses not only on designers and artists who are not that familiar with script writing, but also on Flash professionals. In order to make their work easier FFL contains sophisticated features to build, organize, reuse and distribute Adobe Flash effects and movies.
FFL comes with an open module SDK which enables to build one's own nodes for use in the FFL environment using regular actionscript code.

<p><b>+ Krisztián Kelner: Re:orient - migrating architectures</b></p>
<p>
"Re:orient - migrating architectures" explores the local aspects of China's global significance and increasing influence. The project seeks to forecast possibilities which are now detectable only in connection with retail, but which will, in all likelihood, determine the built environment, which transforms under the pressure of ever-cheaper products. The project follows up these ideas with the presentation of spaces, architectural devices and materials that create new contents, and indicate ways of turning these constraints of the market to our benefit, show how to infuse the mass products, which are designed to have a short life-span, with lasting cultural values.

<p><b>+ Enrique Erne: NetPD</b></p>
<p>
NetPD is an environment made for jam sessions on a network based on Pure Data. It's a client-server system, so it works on any network (internet included). But this is not just intended as a platform for creating sounds, but as an environment where every client (i.e. every computer connected to a NetPD server) can share its PD-patches (instruments). The most interesting part is that the same patches can be played through NetPD, and this implemented feature triggers the jam sessions, welcoming all the different contributions.
