  <div class="title">Dorkbot-Budapest is calling for presentations</div>
  <br />

<p>The purpose of Dorkbot meetings is to nurture local electronic arts communities
and to encourage both emerging, and established artists to present new works
for informal peer review; establish a forum for the presentation of new
technology related art; help establish relationships and foster collaboration
between people with various backgrounds and interests. Dorkbot groups encourage
the free exchange of ideas in the field of electronic arts all around the world
with at over thirty local Dorkbots holding monthly meetings.</p>

<p>We are looking for people who want to present their art and technology-related
projects or ideas (in English or Hungarian) at a Dorkbot-Budapest event.</p>

<p>Some imaginary presentation topics are: a demo of the new motion tracking
software you're writing; playing a video you made; an explanation of how you
hacked your game boy to get it to make cool bleeping noises; trouble shooting
your remote-controlled sandwich making robot; bringing in some dancers you're
working with and having them demonstrate the interface used in your new
mind-control ballet; discussing your approach to electronic sculpture.</p>

<p>If you have questions or would like to present your project at the next
Dorkbot-Budapest contact us at: dorkbotbudapest at dorkbot org.</p>
