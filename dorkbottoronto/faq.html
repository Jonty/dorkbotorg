		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<p><strong>What is dorkbot-Toronto?</strong><br>
See our "<a href="whatis.html">What is Dorkbot-Toronto</a>" page. </p>
			<p><strong>What's the format? </strong><br>

<p><strong>Why did you start Dorkbot-Toronto? </strong><br>We started Dorkbot-Toronto so that people in the Toronto area interested in art and technology would have a meeting place where they could learn about, discuss and work on creative projects. </p>
<p><strong>So how is Dorkbot-Toronto different from an Artist Talk? </strong><br>Artist talks are generally organized by a gallery or educational institution and are more formal where a single artist presents their past work and achievements. Dorkbot events, while sometimes in a gallery space, are informal and quite unrelated to its host space. It is also an event where hands-on work can be explored and multiple discussions are encouraged. </p>
<p><strong>What if I want to speak or present my project at a Dorkbot-Toronto? </strong><br>Send an email to <a href="mailto:dorkbottoronto@dorkbot.org">dorkbottoronto@dorkbot.org</a> and tell us why and what you want to present. Keep in mind that after the presentations, it's pretty much open so you are welcome to bring your ideas/projects in and engage in discussion with other participants. </p>
