By weaving the two together, we seek to reinvest the latest technology with some of the awe and mystery which surrounded the clockwork and  automata of the past.</p><p>In its Harbourfront Centre incarnation the installation is comprised of 71 music boxes, each of which play the same four bars from Erik Satie's 1904 composition "Je Te Veux". The music boxes have been modified to produce as many different timbres as possible within the limits of the simple machines. The boxes are arranged on the wall in a pattern that mimics the notes of the composition along the music box cylinder, the round composition is rolled flat on the wall, like a map to be explored in all directions.</p><p>Annie MacDonell works in photography, collage, film and installation. She acquired her BFA at Ryerson's School of Image Arts in photography, then went on to study at Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, in France. Her work has been shown in Canada and abroad.</p><p>ALEX GEDDIE (b. 1976) attended Ryerson and OCAD in Toronto, and Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing, France.

Behind the easel are a videocamera, computer and projector. As a user paints, thesystem tracks and processes the motion of the brush, andin response projects digital brush strokes onto thecanvas. Simultaneously, the action of painting triggers adramatic audio narrative complete with sound effects andmusic.</p><p>Visually, the layers of a famed artist's work areprogressively applied, while the audio narrative exploringthe story of the artist is controlled by the speed atwhich the user is painting.</p><p>Experientially, the user is literally painting the storyof the artist - all through a magical interface designedto be as simple and accessible as a paintbrush and canvas.</p><p>Painting The Myth seamlessly integrates form and function,setting a new standard for interactive installation. Thesystem benefits both clients and users in the art gallerysector with an innovative and educational technologicalexperience, offering access to a state of emotional andphysical involvement impossible in traditional media.</p><a href="http://nthdgr.org/PTMyth/" target="_blank">http://nthdgr.org/PTMyth/</a>			<p class="style1">&nbsp;		</p><p class="style1">.....</p><p class="style1">Dorkbot-Toronto is always free and open to the public.<br>  For more information, email <a href="mailto:dorkbottoronto@dorkbot.org">dorkbottoronto@dorkbot.org</a></p>	</div><div class="menu" style="position: absolute; top: 120px; left: 20px;">		<a href="../whatis.html">What is Dorkbot?</a><br>		<a href="../faq.html">Dorkbot FAQ</a><br>		<a href="../archive.html">Archive</a><br>		<a href="../http://www.dorkbot.org" target="blank">Dorkbot.org</a><br>		<a href="../gallery.html">Gallery</a><br>		<a href="../mailinglist.html">Mailing List(s)</a><br>		<a href="../links.html">Links</a><br>		<a href="../location.html">Location</a></div><div></div></body></html>
