Known to push the boundaries of his musical form from designing new or manipulating existing sound making devices and software to creative uses of production environments and sound sources, naws music is a blend of sound manipulation/design, experimental musics and dub-tech rhythms, which on the surface sound quite simple, but incorporate a number of touches that steer this artist away from being simply another minimal techno or experimental laptop artist. He combines post-house, dubby minimal techno, microsound and thick ambience, to create his own version of deep techno, house and other electronic laptop orineted musics. Neil has released music on various national and international record labels, including releases on Noise Factory, Complot, Clevermusic, Piehead, A/S Systems, Wabi and Pertin_nce. As naw, Neil has performed extensively along side a variety of national and international artists both in and outside of Canada. In 2004 and 2005 naw will release his follow up noise factory record full length called: "green nights orange days", as well as a full length outting with Pertin_nce Records called: "terrain vague". these 2 records finds Neil at his deepest, dubbiest and experimental sounding yet. the release of these records will co inside with a series of North American and European tour dates through out 2005.</p><a href="http://www.naw.phoniq.net/" title="http://www.owenmilburn.com" target="_blank">www.naw.phoniq.net/</a><h2>Naw & Plogue</h2>Neil will discuss his work as an electronic musican and sound artist and will demo the Biddule software that he uses to make his music.<a href="http://www.plogue.com/bidule" target="_blank">http://www.plogue.com/bidule</a><h1><a name="mydokidoki"></a>Jonathan Resnick / James Milward / Trevor Shaikin</h1><p>Jonathan is a media designer with an extensive background in software engineering.  His interests include interactive design, social computing, augmented realities and media art.  He enjoys working with forms that transcend established technological frameworks, and exploring the power of the networked world as a means to extend human consciousness and connection.</p><p>A professional problem solver, James is one of those people that you just love to have around.

When was the last time you felt it pound, or skip a beat? Was it from excitement? Fear? Attraction?</p><p>Our heartbeat is a direct line to our emotional and physical state. Imagine you could share it with others? Who would you choose to share it with? A lover? A friend? A stranger? Can we interact with people on a deeper level by tuning in to a whole new channel of body language?</p><p>The concept behind my doki-doki is to enable you to see and feel your heartbeat and share the experience with others.
