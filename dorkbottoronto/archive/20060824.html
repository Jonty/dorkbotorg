By displaying the edge view (thickness) of the photographic material on a very large scale, the physicality of the photograph is emphasized and all trace of the image contained within the photograph is eliminated. The only reference to the image content is through the use of captions and associated text. By removing the image, the viewer is left to consider the photograph on new grounds, as both a photographic object and a photographic image and to establish where different forms of value attributed to photographs actually exist.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to the support of the Project Open Source Open Access initiative at the University of Toronto, an online, digital version of this project will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License. Releasing the artwork in this manner will result in wider distribution and a much larger audience than could be achieved through a physical gallery exhibition. It will allow individuals to download, print and thus own a copy of the artwork (at not cost to the creators of the artwork) and allows for the images to be used as building blocks by other artists. Ideally, this project may help to set a precedent for other artists to release work in a similar fashion.<br>  Dave Kemp is a Toronto-based visual artist currently working towards his Master of Visual Studies at the University of Toronto. He is also the first Visual Studies candidate to be accepted into the Knowledge Media Design collaborative program. Prior to his studies at the University of Toronto, he earned his Image Arts (photography) BFA from Ryerson University after completing a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Queen&rsquo;s University. </p><h1><a name="Th.Loa"></a>Dan Zen</h1>			<p>Mad inventor Dan Zen, discusses Zen Mix - the number one vlogging tool listed on Google that lets you put Web video on a Web picture and apply cool effects to it in just a few minutes for free! </p>			<p><a href="http://www.zenmix.com" target="_blank">http://www.zenmix.com</a></p>			<h1><a name="mazur"></a>Matt Mazur </h1>			<p>Matt Mazur - <a href="http://www.elftrance.com">Elftrance.com</a></p>			<p>Matt will be showcasing several of his digital creations - full-spectrum<br>				multimedia projects full of animation, music, multiuser programming. and<br>				monkeys.</p>			<p>Elftrance.com is a unique website full of Flash animation and philosophy,<br>				with the intent to encourage creative perspectives in human evolution and to<br>				create a positive mythology for our global future.</p>			<p>Buddhatron.com is a work-in-progress site exploring multiuser interaction<br>				via Flash Unity 2 multiuser server technology.
