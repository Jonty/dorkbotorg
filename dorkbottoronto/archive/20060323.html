Meaning is acomplex tapestry created from patches of theory. These patches are inconstant flux and reorganization. Meaning is the process of rethinkingand reconsidering. The patches of meaning do not always connectelegantly. Meaning is overgrown with seams. The caretakers of meaningare not only individuals but a multiplicity of objects and subjects.Meaning grows from the community negotiation of these seams.</p><p>Resurfacing is the shifting of the frames of viewpoint. The flat surfacebecomes a deep collection of frames from the present, the past and theirintersections.</p><p>Resurfacing captures and archives viewpoints or moments from its owncontext. Moments are evaluated by how they change over time and theextent to which the audience is engaged.</p><p>Ben is an installation artist, visual performer and programmer. He worksin an open-source context and makes all the software he develops, thatis of general use, available under the GPL. His installations createcontent live and on the fly in response to the work's sensedenvironment.  These works may involve interaction from the audience as apart of the environment, or the work may simply respond to the contextin which it exists.  Ben is a structural thinker and imagines his workas the production of media architectures. Physical modelling, chaos,feedback systems and evolutionary algorithms have been used to informand and engage in his creative process. Ben is the author of  thepixelTANGO visual performance software funded by the Société des artstechnologues. Ben is currently collaborating with architect Donna MarieVakalis creating an interactive architectural installation made possibleby the Canada Council for the Arts. Ben has also received a travel grantfrom the Canada Council for the Arts to participate in the pixelACHEfestival in Helsinki, Finland in April 2005. Ben has presented work inToronto, Ottawa, Montréal, Vancouver, Seattle, Helsinki, Bergen andBarcelona.</p><a href="http://www.ekran.org/ben" target="_blank">http://www.ekran.org/ben</a><br><p>Candidate for Master of Architecture at the University of Toronto; currentlyresearching intersections of computing and design, especially environmentsfor generative component-based modelling and computer-aided fabricationmethods.
