When was the last time you felt it pound, or skip a beat? 			Was it from excitement? Fear? Attraction?<p>Our heartbeat is a direct line to our emotional and physical state. Imagine you could share it with others? Who would you choose to share it with? A lover? A friend? A stranger? Can we interact with people on a deeper level by tuning in to a whole new channel of body language?</p><p>The concept behind my doki-doki is to enable you to see and feel your heartbeat and share the experience with others. By providing a visceral expression of your heartbeat, my doki-doki creates a new kind of self-awareness and a unique opportunity to connect with others.</p><p><a href="http://www.mydokidoki.com">www.mydokidoki.com</a></p><h1><a name="rob"></a>Rob King</h1><p>Rob King is an artist, programmer, and designer based in Toronto.
