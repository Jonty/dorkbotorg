From voice recognition technology (IVR) to environmental control systems, my work uses industrial technologies for artistic applications. By appropriating these technologies and allowing the user to explore the technology in an intimate manner, it is my hope to generate discussion about the nature of human/machine relationships.</p><a href="http://www.bungalow.ca" target="_blank">http://www.bungalow.ca</a><h2>GreenHouse</h2><p>GreenHouse represents the merger of industry, science and technology in the creation of an art system that directly challenges the distinction between what is natural and what is synthetic. GreenHouse explores the interflow of life support signals between a fully-automated greenhouse and a single orchid flower housed within it.  Data collected from a weather station located in the orchid's native habitat will be collected in real-time over a network connection. This weather information will then be used by a control system to create a simulation of this natural environment within the greenhouse.</p><a href="http://www.bungalow.ca./greenhouse/" target="_blank">www.bungalow.ca/greenhouse/</a><h1><a name="owen"></a>Owen Milburn</h1><p>I am an interactive-digital-media artist/designer and producer living in Toronto, and a recent alumnus of the Interactive Arts and Entertainment Programme at the Canadian Film Centre. Prior to living in Toronto, I was in Vancouver completing my undergraduate studies at Simon Fraser University in the Interactive Arts & Technology program.</p><p>My work has primarily been in the field of physical-computing and designing software interactions that occur away from the screen and without a mouse or keypad (see portfolio: installations). My physical-computing installations have been featured in a number of galleries and festivals in Canada, including The Western Front and the NewForms Festival Gallery in Vancouver and Digifest in Toronto.</p><p>Aside form my work in physical computing, my educational backgound includes theory and practice of user-centrered and participatory design methodologies. I also work with interactive and linear audio and video, with digital and physical images (2D and 3D), and do some work on the web. My experience using a wide range of software is helpful when producing large and diverse interactive digital projects.</p><a href="http://www.owenmilburn.com" title="http://www.owenmilburn.com" target="_blank">www.owenmilburn.com</a><h2>Right or Left Unsaid</h2><p>Right or Left Unsaid  is an interactive installation which engages participants in a collaborative activity designed to draw awareness to one's relationship with oneself and to other people. Participants interact with each other by moving their hands over the surface of hexagonal table. As this happens, lines of moving words appear between hands, linking them together. The words explore different relationships and states of being alone or within a group.</p><a href="http://www.sohei-design.com/punchcardinteractive/e/project.html" target="_blank">Right or Left Unsaid website</a><h1><a name="jeremy"></a>Jeremy Rotsztain</h1><p>Jeremy Rotsztain is a Toronto-based artist/programmer who works with responsive and evolving media systems. His interests span from audio-visual performance to interactive architecture, and "video painting" installations. In 2003, he created BIXSimulator, a realtime 3D simulator for the award winning BIX media facade in Graz, Austria. He has also worked closely with a number of theatre and dance companies to create media-based components for their productions. Jeremy has performed and exhibited his work in Berlin, Frankfurt, Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and New York City.</p><a href="http://www.mantissa.ca" target="_blank">www.mantissa.ca</a><h2>BIX Simulator</h2><p>A real-time 3D simulation of Realities-United's award-winning BIX Media Fa&ccedil;ade. The application was developed to enable artists to see how their video work will appear when displayed on the BIX fa√ßade, a 3-story screen made of 925 flourescent bulbs that displays low-resoltion movies. The application provides the option to navigate around the city of Graz to see how the video will appear from different perspectives.</p><a href="http://www.bix.at" target="_blank">www.bix.at</a>			<p class="style1">&nbsp;		</p><p class="style1">.....</p><p class="style1">Dorkbot-Toronto is always free and open to the public.<br>  For more information, email <a href="mailto:dorkbottoronto@dorkbot.org">dorkbottoronto@dorkbot.org</a></p>	</div><div class="menu" style="position: absolute; top: 120px; left: 20px;">		<a href="../whatis.html">What is Dorkbot?</a><br>		<a href="../faq.html">Dorkbot FAQ</a><br>		<a href="../archive.html">Archive</a><br>		<a href="../http://www.dorkbot.org" target="blank">Dorkbot.org</a><br>		<a href="../gallery.html">Gallery</a><br>		<a href="../mailinglist.html">Mailing List(s)</a><br>		<a href="../links.html">Links</a><br>		<a href="../location.html">Location</a></div><div></div></body></html>
