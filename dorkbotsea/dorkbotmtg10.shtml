                      Of Matter</i>&#148;: Whether working as an artist, collaborating 
                      on a public art project or bossing corporate CEOs as a graphic 
                      designer, chemistry (literal and metaphorical) has been 
                      vital to the work of Seattle-based artist Ellen Ziegler 
                      (<a href="http://www.ellenziegler.com" target="_blank"><b>http://www.ellenziegler.com</b></a>). 
                      Her work is shown locally and nationally, and includes installations 
                      incorporating water as a subject and medium, large works 
                      on paper using chemically-altered light-sensitive media, 
                      and public artworks, among them fountains and water features. 
                      Ellen will talk about her &#147;new and used&#148; works 
                      and the processes she has evolved to create them. In her 
                      own words, &#147;When I place objects on light-sensitive 
                      surfaces in the sun, I never know how the image will turn 
                      out. Or whether it will. Processing the materials with a 
                      garden hose, I watch the objects appear as transformed ghosts. 
                      When I draw on the images with household chemicals or power 
                      tools, unexpected reactions occur. Chemistry is the emotion 
                      of matter. With these processes, form filters through the

                    <p><b>Toby Paddock</b> is &quot;just some guy that thinks 
                      hall effect sensors are kind of neat and that everyone should 
                      know about them&quot;. He also likes to listen to audio 
                      frequency magnetic fields using homemade pickup coils, but 
                      that's a different thing altogether. Tinkers with sound, 
                      electronics, and field recording, but mostly speculates 
                      about projects that never get started. Is trying to develop 
                      the &quot;Shut Up And Solder&quot; method of actually getting 
                      something built. He works for an aerospace electronics company 
                      in the environmental test labs and lives in Everett, WA 
                      with his wife, 2 kids, 1 fish, 2 cats, 1 dog, and a hamster. 
                      They appreciate his enthusiasm for his hobbies, however, 
                      not sharing his unique admiration of sound often send him 
                      to the garage. <a href="http://www.conceptlab.com/interviews/kluver.html"><b>http://www.seanet.com/~tpaddock/</b></a>

                    <p><b>Laura MacCary</b> is a weaver who has also been studying 
                      electronics for the last few years. Laura is interested 
                      in the idea of weaving as a ubiquitous but little-noticed 
                      technology, unvalued while still essential to human survival. 
                      Electronics is another technology that is becoming so omnipresent 
                      and so integrated with our lives that we will soon cease 
                      to notice it. However, electronics is sure to cross the 
                      boundary of our skin, and enter our bodies. Its fields already 
                      do. It is this intimate interface between people and technology 
                      that Laura examines in this series of works. Each piece 
                      in the series consists of an electronic component woven 
                      of conductive or resistive materials cast-off by industry, 
                      and a circuit designed around it. By interacting with the 
                      weaving the viewer physically enters the circuit, and the 
                      circuit passes through the viewer, blurring the boundary 
                      between them. The title of the series, Dialectric, is taken 
                      from the words dialectic, meaning the juxtaposition or interaction 
                      of two conflicting ideas or forces, and dielectric, an insulating 
                      substance or one in which an electric field can be maintained 
                      with a minimum loss of power. Laura sees these as metaphors 
                      for the participants in an interaction, and the space between 
                      them. This series is also an opportunity to collaborate 
                      with her father, longtime electronics experimenter and sculptor 
                      Lawrence MacCary, and she see the works as metaphors for 
                      aspects of their relationship, and relationships in general.

                    <p><b>Kevin Hilbiber</b>: Kevin's first show was at the 1968 
                      Ghiradelli Square International Childrens' Art Center, where 
                      he displayed 'wire sketches', funny cars and shopping carts, 
                      figures from Saul Steinberg and Charles Scultz - &quot;kid 
                      stuff&quot; created from leftover scraps of leadwire taken 
                      from components he soldered into pc boards for his father 
                      when he was 12. Other career highlights include an interactive 
                      sound and light sculpture show called Softscience in 1985 
                      at silkscreen collective Survival Graphics (Madison, WI), 
                      which was the first ever non-print based show held at that 
                      venue. A year later, Softscience became the name of Kevin's 
                      Amp Tech shop, which ran for the next 10 years. Kevin is 
                      a founder of Ballard's House of Science, holds an ATA degree 
                      in electronics and lives &quot;a hazy, slacker's life otherwise&quot;.
