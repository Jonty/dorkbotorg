Speaking at a future dorkbot-sea</p>

<p><b>
What’s the format of a dorkbot meeting?</b><br>
Each dorkbot-sea meeting consists of:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Brief intros, announcements, administrative details<br> 
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a<br> 
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a<br> 
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q &amp; a<br> 
<li>Final comments/debate/mingling etc..</ul></p>

<p>
We will sometimes deviate from this formula if you have a suitable special event that you’d like to propose, but typically we like to have three speakers for an evening as it gives more of us a chance to strut our dorky stuff.</p>

<p class=highlight>
What should I present?</p>

<p>
<b>Imaginary presentation topics: </b></p>

<p><ul>
<li>A demo of the new motion tracking software you're writing 
<li>Playing a video you made 
<li>An explanation of how you hacked your game boy to get it to make cool bleeping noises 
<li>Trouble shooting/brainstorming your remote-controlled sandwich making robot 
<li>Bringing in some dancers you're working with and having them demonstrate the interface used in your new mind-control ballet 
<li>Discussing your approach to electronic sculpture </p></ul>

<p>
Demos of commercial software are not appropriate, unless you wrote the software or you are making it do something particularly novel or interesting. On the other hand, presenting a piece that was created using commercial software is fine.</p> 

<p class=highlight>Do I get paid to speak?</p>

<p>
No.  We don’t charge admission and we don’t pay speakers - dorkbot-sea is a free, community event.</p>
