                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>N.A.G. (Network Auralization for Gnutella) is interactive 
                  software art for Mac OS X and Windows 2000/XP which turns the 
                  process of searching for and downloading MP3 files into a chaotic 
                  musical collage. Users type in search keywords, and N.A.G. looks 
                  for matches on the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network. 
                  The software then downloads MP3 files which match the search 
                  keyword(s) and remixes these audio files in real time based 
                  on the structure of the Gnutella network itself. The piece on 
                  this CD, N.A.G. (Network Auralization for Gnutella): Dorkbot 
                  Mix, was created by searching for the words &quot;dork&quot; 
                  and &quot;bot&quot; with the N.A.G. software. The program's 
                  output was not further edited or processed in any way. N.A.G. 
                  is a 2003 commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc., 
                  (dba Ether-Ore), for its Turbulence web site. It was made possible 
                  with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The software 
                  is available free of charge at <a href="http://turbulence.org/Works/freeman/" target="_blank"><b>http://turbulence.org/Works/freeman/</b></a>.

                  <b>STATEMENT</b> <br>
                  Jason Freeman's works break down conventional barriers between 
                  composers, performers, and listeners, using cutting-edge technology 
                  and unconventional notation to turn audiences and musicians 
                  into compositional collaborators. His music has been performed 
                  by Speculum Musicae, the So Percussion Group, the Nieuw Ensemble, 
                  Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne, and Evan Ziporyn, and his interactive 
                  installations and software art have been exhibited at the Lincoln 
                  Center Festival, the Boston CyberArt Festival, and the Transmediale 
                  Festival and featured in the New York Times and on National 
                  Public Radio. <br>
                  <br>
                  Glimmer, a new work for chamber orchestra, live electronics, 
                  and audience interaction, will be premiered by the American 
                  Composers Orchestra at Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall in January 
                  2005. Freeman graduated summa cum laude from Yale University 
                  and is currently a doctoral candidate at Columbia University, 
                  where he also teaches computer music. He recently completed 
                  a year-long fellowship at Akademie Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart, 
                  Germany, where he worked with a team led by sound artist Max 
                  Neuhaus to create Auracle, a voice-controlled networked sound 
                  instrument. <br>
