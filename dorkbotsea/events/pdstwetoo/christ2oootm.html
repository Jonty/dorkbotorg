                  DESCRIPTION/STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>On television during the beginning of the year 2004, an 
                  American pick-up truck company marketed their products under 
                  the guise: 'man possessing truck with turbo booster (HEMI) is 
                  more powerful, more important than fellow man.' In the commercial, 
                  the guy in the HEMI-powered pick-up drag races two goofs in 
                  a muscle car from one stop light to the next; the goofs try 
                  but just cannot keep up. The fun ends with the announcer aggressively 
                  asking, with the text jumping on the monitor, &quot;GOTTA HEMI!?&quot; 
                  (The question leaves the one pondering whether they have what 
                  it takes to stay ahead of goofs.)</p>
                <p>I experienced this commercial numerous times, during which 
                  I became increasingly bothered by their reflection of societies 
                  ill-ways toward product promotion and also the sad state of 
                  masculinity in this country. The more I pondered the decline 
                  of civilization the more bothered I became, until my perturbation 
                  erupted through me yelling through my mini-digi-4track recorder. 
                  I found a vibrant effect to run my voice through and I continued 
                  singing, &quot;Hey man, you gotta HEMI!?&quot; After playback 
                  I noticed how remarkably close the recording sounds to, &quot;Hey 
                  man, you gotta hear me!&quot; </p>
                <p>This unintentional interpretation of what I was saying is pertinent 
                  as to why I am yelling and why I express myself as an artist 
                  in the first place. I reflected on how this advertisement had 
                  reached me emotionally and how I was reacting to being upset. 
                  I thought of my inner-self, the voice I hear when I can get 
                  myself into I very quiet and calm space. The part of me that 
                  feels calm despite whatever demise surrounds.</p>
                <p>I immediately added a second vocal track, sent through an effect 
                  that accentuates a calm, steady, inner-self sound, akin to a 
                  slow heartbeat. I'll refer to this track as the bass. The bass 
                  is opposite the treble verse in many ways. A major contrast 
                  is that the bass consists of only a couple simple sounds repeated, 
                  &quot;a bump-bump, a bump-bump.&quot; Even though only a few 
                  words are repeated, they are often pronounced in ways far from 
                  familiar or repetitious; hence, they come across as much more 
                  than just two sounds. The bass tracks calmness and narrowness 
                  of tonal range contrasts the angst filled tone of the treble 
                  verse, composed in a broad tonal range, ending in near screech. 
                  The two voices share compliments too, mostly tonal harmonies 
                  that periodically occur between the voices.</p>
                <p>All sounds are generated from my voice alone; though, through 
                  two different digital effects on two separate tracks. No editing 
                  was done to the tracks; only the two tracks levels were adjusted 
                  in relationship to one another as they were mixed to mp3 format.
