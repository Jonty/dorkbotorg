                  BIO <br>
                  </b>In June of 1999, Cynthia Norton relocated from Chicago to 
                  Brooklyn, New York, and now resides in Louisville, Kentucky 
                  as of July 2001. <br>
                  <br>
                  Her undergraduate years were busy in Lexington, Kentucky working 
                  under Professor Shawn Brixey at the University of Kentucky Media 
                  Lab. Norton's work in Kentucky derived out of an inspiration 
                  to create kaleidoscopic videos presented as video &quot;quilts&quot;. 
                  Performances created during this time were documented into these 
                  videos and displayed as installation pieces. Norton furthered 
                  her education in Chicago, receiving a Masters of Time Arts Degree 
                  from The Art Institute of Chicago in 1995. At the Art Institute 
                  she worked in the Time Arts department, developing her rube-like 
                  persona Ninnie Na&iuml;ve. Utilizing the kinetic, Art and Technology 
                  Department equipment, she built a machine that cooked bread 
                  hairdos. Norton combined performance, sound, kinetics and installation 
                  elements to give the viewer a folk inspired connection to technological 
                  ideas. For her innovations in sound she was mentioned in a book 
                  by Greil Marcus entitled, &quot;Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan's 
                  Basement Tapes&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Norton communicates homespun ideas and socio-political concepts, 
                  of form and content, into an accessible art form. Drawing from 
                  the history of famous and lesser known female voices and personalities, 
                  Norton creates her original vehicles of sound and expression 
                  in which to investigate cultural and technical aesthetics. <br>
                  <br>
                  For the last 11 years, Norton's interests lie in American folk 
                  music history and inferring about gender technology, and as 
                  a parallel, she to is dealing with it, building and programming 
                  her kinetic pieces. She uses mixing bowls, lamp stands, a kitchen 
                  table, and dresses, among other household items. Norton builds 
                  her devices creating the sentiment that a woman, &quot;Ninnie&quot;, 
                  made the props from her surroundings. <br>
                  <br>
                  Through lyrics, folk music relayed messages of social history 
                  and the technological advances in people's lives. For example, 
                  two songs featured in the 1994 performance, &quot;Bun In The 
                  Oven&quot;, and &quot;Ninnie's&quot; Compact Disc (Cotton Candy 
                  Country,'95) is: &quot;The Pill&quot; by Loretta Lynn and &quot;Washwoman's&quot; 
                  Blues by Bessie Smith. The performance installation explored 
                  folk mythology through: music, instruments, an autobiographical 
                  monologue, kinetics, a real-time video quilt, and bread baking. 
                  Norton explored the way women played a major role in the history 
                  of folk music. Women preserved the early roots of American Music 
                  by passing down the mores generation to generation. As a result 
                  folk music preserved the heritage that we use as insight for 
                  our culture. Norton's performance work encompasses an aspiration 
                  to merge aspects of technology, media, folk music, history and 
                  storytelling. <br>
                  <br>
                  In the performance installation, &quot;Bun In The Oven&quot;, 
                  Norton used bread dough as a medium for sculpting hairdos onto 
                  hair school mannequin heads. These heads were put on a sculpture, 
                  a kinetic carousel for rotating and baking, which pass under 
                  a heating element. Hollowed out shellacked bread was also used 
                  to build instruments entitled &quot;Bread Badminton Blues Rackets&quot;. 
                  The hollowed-out bread was glued to de-stringed badminton rackets. 
                  Tuning keys were mounted on the handles of the rackets and strung 
                  with various instrument strings. Pick-up microphones were placed 
                  under the bridge and held into position with a clothespin. They 
                  were played by musicians in the performance as sound accompaniment 
                  to her monologue and singing. Technology for &quot;Ninnie&quot; 
                  can be as simple as a recipe or a song. <br>
                  <br>
                  In 1998 Norton was invited to perform internationally as &quot;Ninnie 
                  Na&iuml;ve&quot;, at the Berlin International Performance Congress. 
                  With a new performance video, entitled &quot;DisContent&quot;, 
                  &quot;Ninnie&quot; shows a more subversive side. She performed 
                  a live version of the tune &quot;Single Girl&quot;, by Ruby 
                  Vass, a song that waivers between single independence and married 
                  motherhood. Her Loretta Lynn tribute took on a new level of 
                  intent with the use of temporary tattoos and a jaw harp solo. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Norton continued the ephemeral artwork for &quot;Ninnie&quot; 
                  by designing the temporary tattoo. The design signifies &quot;Ninnie's 
                  Blues&quot; as a Finnish artist described her. It is an image 
                  of Ninnie as a cross between Man Ray's Violin d'Ingres and the 
                  hat with a price tag of Minnie Pearl. This image represents 
                  the merging of two genres and the need to look at the culture 
                  in American historical personalities. Norton animated the tattoos 
                  in her video, &quot;DisContent&quot;, and used them in installations 
                  and as performance props. <br>
                  <br>
                  In a performance exchange with Toronto artists, entitled Eleven 
                  Eleven, Norton displayed &quot;Pick'in On My Heart Strings&quot;, 
                  a two channel kinetic sound sculpture that holds an instrument 
                  made out of angle food cake and allows the viewer to hear a 
                  CD playing inside an old wooden record player. The instrument 
                  is plucked by a motor while the sound is amplified. The CD playing 
                  inside highlights two songs by Norton and others patterned after 
                  Skeeter Davis, drawing attention to a more vulnerable yet powerful 
                  sound adaptation. This performance installation entitled, &quot;I'm 
                  a Voyeur&quot;, exposed a transition between &quot;Ninnie&quot; 
                  as a subject and &quot;Ninnie&quot; as a cultural worker. <br>
                  <br>
                  In 2002, Cynthia has shown new work at Swanson Reed Contemporary; 
                  Louisville, Kentucky. As sculpture she has built a moonshine 
                  still, entitled &quot;Emotion&quot;; this functional object 
                  was activated through performance entitled &quot;Double-Agent 
                  Workhorse&quot;. This work is an exploration of personal, political 
                  and cultural economy. The thought of moonshiners as cultural 
                  workers and artisans of our region are a parallel to that of 
                  the role of artist and performance art. The still, a kinetic 
                  sculpture, is a metaphor to describe emotional desire. It redefines 
                  the mechanical as a metaphysical system or &quot;gradient relationship&quot;. 
                  &quot;Gradient Relationship&quot; is the title of a video loop 
                  in the exhibit in which &quot;Ninnie&quot; is singing the folk 
                  song &quot;Single Girl&quot; as the sound track. <br>
                  <br>
                  In October 2003 Norton returned to Germany performing at the 
                  9th Annual International Congress for Performance and Visual 
                  Art. Taking on the challenge of showing at this festival she 
                  has produced some new instruments that expresses irony through 
                  he use of assorted traveling cases and a dictionary. Currently, 
                  Cynthia has completed a new kinetic sculpture entitled &quot;Dancing 
                  Squared&quot;. This sculpture is comprised of four square dancing 
                  dresses spinning in unison while the entire sculpture revolves.
