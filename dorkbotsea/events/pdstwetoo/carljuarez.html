                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Interstellar Intercept (#23 in the Posthuman Ethnography 
                  series) combines two recordings made nearly 25 years apart using 
                  fundamentally dissimilar technologies yet employing related 
                  concepts of temporal manipulation. Sounds were generated or 
                  transduced into patterns of magnetic flux embodying analog or 
                  digital information; once rendered malleable, they were then 
                  orchestrated and mixed in the digital domain. Structurally this 
                  composition, with its multiple overlays of self-similar material, 
                  resembles fractal (1/f) music and some Javanese gamelan. <br>
                  <br>
                  I began with some of my first experimental musical recordings 
                  from 1980, created from the autogenerative feedback of a cassette 
                  recorder. These were time-stretched by repeated use of analog 
                  tape speed manipulation, then time-compressed to approximately 
                  two seconds in length. No noise reduction was used in these 
                  processes, the result being that the original signal has been 
                  largely overwhelmed by noise and at some points harmonics of 
                  the local electrical grid&sup1;s 60-cycle hum. These textures 
                  have been supplemented with a location recording made with a 
                  digital camera earlier this year, which has been stretched several 
                  times in duration, pitch-shifted into audible range, and further 
                  processed. <br>
                  <br>
                  This material was assembled and mixed with minimal processing 
                  in Pro Tools at Heurihermilab in December 2004. <br>
