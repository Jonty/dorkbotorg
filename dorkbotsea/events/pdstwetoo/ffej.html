                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>&quot;Modern Day Gavel&quot; is a selection from Ffej's 
                  self-released CD Patterns in the Storm Vol. I. The album consists 
                  of musical pieces generated by a wide variety of techniques 
                  in analog synthesis and random synchronization. Mechanical polyrhythms 
                  are created by fine tuning a number of time based factors in 
                  the music such as oscillators, arpeggiators, trigger rates, 
                  envelopes, sequencing and delay. Imagine music made to the out 
                  of sync turn signals on cars lined up in the turning lane. The 
                  results range from that of an agitated frenzy to a full bodied 
                  drone. This song has turned out among the few that some may 
                  consider &quot;danceable&quot;, probably because it's the only 
                  one that incorporates MIDI. And it is, indeed, a synthesizer 
                  making that noise, not an angry chipmunk.<br>
