                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>My music is oriented toward various modes of editing. I 
                  released a full length LP which was of Musique Concrete edits 
                  done on &frac14;&quot; tape, the sound source being primarily 
                  guitar. This track has been spliced by hand from reel tape before 
                  being bumped to both DAT tape and 4-track cassette. Multi-tracks 
                  were mixed to the computer, then further edited to change the 
                  sequencing, and effects were added. This was over a period of 
                  two years. The material has been released on a CDR label in 
                  Poland. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>STATEMENT</b> <br>
                  My background is in visual art and music. The two interests 
                  are synonymous and go back many years. I find that they help 
                  inform my aesthetics in an interdisciplinary way. I have always 
                  had an enthusiasm for abstract forms of music and have always 
                  enjoyed musique concrete and improvised music. These influence 
                  my approach to painting. <br>
                  <br>
                  I worked in radio for several years at KMUN in Astoria, developing 
                  a feel for improvised mixing on air, and work in the medium 
                  of reel to reel tape. My music tries to reflect any number of 
                  approaches to the sequencing and editing of sound, relying on 
                  the general feeo of electro-acoustic music. I also seek to create 
                  a new point of reference for the guitar in a non-traditional 
                  setting, while hopefully evoking the timelessness of the guitar 
                  as a narrative instrument. <br>
