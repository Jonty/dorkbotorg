                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Here, I thought of sharing with you a little bit of the 
                  folk traditions of my beloved Brazil. Rabo-de-Arraia (2004) 
                  comes from several memories of watching Capoeira circles (&quot;rodas 
                  de capoeira&quot;). With more than 400 years of history, Capoeira 
                  is a true piece of Brazilian culture. More than simply a martial 
                  art, it is a dance, a sport, a game, a powerful musical event. 
                  If I was ever to film a Capoeira circle, with its dancer-fighters 
                  spinning around and around against an ever-changing backdrop 
                  of drummers and Berimbau players, I would most likely use several 
                  cameras, so one's eye would be everywhere: acrobatic eyes. But 
                  I only have microphones. And computers! It is curious to note 
                  that he whole ensemble of Capoeira musicians in this piece was 
                  actually recreated by computer algorithms programmed to improvise 
                  according to traditional styles. It is an automatic Capoeira-loom, 
                  perhaps? <br>

                  <b> BIO/STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Marcus Bittencourt is a Brazilian composer and pianist based 
                  in the USA. He studied music with composers such as Willy Correa 
                  de Oliveira and Tristan Murail, and he is best described as 
                  an Experimental musician, for he is a practitioner of a type 
                  of music which lives outside known traditions. Because of this, 
                  his music is marked by an extremely varied palette of musical 
                  sound materials and techniques, which reflect his intense investigation 
                  in the domains of form, polyrhythm and simultaneities, timbre, 
                  sound spatial perspective, microtonality, and orchestration 
                  of sound objects. Prolific both as an instrumental and an electroacoustic 
                  composer, his list of compositions includes works for orchestra, 
                  chamber ensembles, choir, solo instruments (specially the piano), 
                  operas, as well as several electroacoustic works. Marcus Bittencourt 
                  has been performing widely as a pianist, conductor, and sound-projectionist, 
                  often taking those tasks simultaneously, as in the case of his 
                  several piano performances with live electronics. His music 
                  has been played throughout the United States, Europe, and Brazil, 
                  and it is available through the Electric Music Collective label:<br>

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Among the awards he has received are the first prize at the 
                  Projeto Nascente V (1996), a seven year scholarship at Columbia 
                  University, and a residency at the Centro Studi Ligure of the 
                  Bogliasco Foundation in Genoa, Italy. His academic credentials 
                  include a Baccalaureate in Piano Performance from the Universidade 
                  de Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Master's and Doctoral degrees in Music 
                  Composition from Columbia University in the City of New York. 
                  He has taught Music at Columbia University and at Lehman College 
                  of CUNY, and he currently teaches Composition, Theory, and Computer 
                  Music at the College of William and Mary in Virginia (USA).

                  <br>
                  Since 2000, he runs his own highly experimental studio for Musique 
                  Concrete, the Zoologico. <br>
