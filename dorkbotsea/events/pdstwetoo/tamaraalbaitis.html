                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>This piece was made mostly with special contact microphones 
                  that pick up electronic currents. It's fascinating to me that 
                  there isn't a single square inch of our environment that isn't 
                  riddled with electronic signals of some form. Anything that 
                  can be plugged in or runs with batteries hums with energy. <br>
                  <br>
                  I walked around my house collecting all the invisible, electronic 
                  noises present in what was normally my personal, seemingly quiet 
                  environment. With my headphones on, the air around me became 
                  magnetically charged, full and digital. Overwhelmed, I'd pull 
                  the headphones off to resume the silence I loved and depended 
                  on for recuperation. <br>
                  <br>
                  Coming from a visual background, I find myself associating texture 
                  and other tactile references to the noises I collect. After 
                  downloading them into my computer, I compose these sonic elements 
                  to portray a situation or highlight an emotion. I layered the 
                  electronic signals from within my house with wind chimes from 
                  the outside of my house. The electronic noises represent a cold, 
                  mechanical feeling; one alienated from a human's touch. The 
                  bamboo wind chimes portrayed an organic feeling: round, alive 
                  and contingent on wind - a life force. I took the organic wind 
                  one step beyond and added recorded sounds of me breathing. I 
                  felt an opposition developing between the definitions of my 
                  space. It was ironic that the inside of my house was densely 
                  packed with angular, mathematical sounds - intrusive and insistent 
                  - while outside the walls, the wind, nature and my bamboo wind 
                  chimes made the environment more inviting. <br>
                  The results of this piece present a contradiction between the 
                  evident, electronic lifestyle we have welcomed into our homes, 
                  and the primal forces that compose us. My interest lies in the 
                  way these two worlds are apparently becoming more compatible.

                  <b> BIO/STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>I create sound work, objects and installations that are 
                  derived from observations in daily life. The present body of 
                  work focuses on &quot;everyday objects&quot; in relation to 
                  our refuge from the turmoil and monotonies in life. Not based 
                  on any religious sectors, I'm interested in how we use objects 
                  in a spiritual sense for fulfillment. <br>
                  <br>
                  After a formal training at Grand Valley State University in 
                  Michigan, I continued my education at the San Francisco Art 
                  Institute (SFAI). Through the school, I traveled to China to 
                  study Taoism and Chinese Landscape Painting. This experience 
                  was crucial for me and led to an intense focus on experiencing 
                  the present moment. It's the everyday, with all of its minuscule 
                  to immense elements that composes our lives. <br>
                  <br>
                  After returning to SFAI, I began to incorporate different mediums 
                  into my practice, crossing disciplines and experimenting with 
                  engaging other physical senses. I graduated from SFAI in May 
                  2002 and currently study as the School of the Art Institute 
                  of Chicago, where my focus is sound composition, sculpture and 
                  multi-sensory installation. <br>
                  <br>
                  In &quot;Morning Glory&quot; 2004, I took a common item - coffee 
                  - and exemplified it through an installation that evoked the 
                  senses of sight and smell. The aromatic smell of coffee wafted 
                  to your nose as you entered what seemed to be a sacred, ritual 
                  space. It was dimly lit with spotlights emphasizing six large 
                  scrolls, hung from the ceiling streaming down to large trays 
                  filled with coffee on the floor. The sound of coffee percolating. 
                  Provoked by hot water, the coffee slowly wicked up the paper, 
                  creating rich, brown markings. This work has lead people to 
                  re-think their morning coffee rituals. <br>
                  <br>
                  Ultimately, my interests lie in life fusing into art and art 
                  fusing back into life, where the commonplace and the transcendent 
                  merge into resolution. I am fascinated by natural order, which 
                  directly links itself to natural chaos and chance. By working 
                  with all our senses - as life does - I'm obscuring our perceived 
                  boundaries between the art object and the environment. <br>
