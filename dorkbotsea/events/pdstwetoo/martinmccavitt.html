                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>This is a self-generating real-time modular synthesis network. 
                  LFO and envelopes are output from Subtractor synthesizers + 
                  NN19 samplers. These outputs are'virtual' control voltages. 
                  The outputs are then patched into control voltage inputs for 
                  pitch, amplifier, gate, envelope and mod wheel depth, etc.. 
                  Control voltage values can be changed on the front face of each 
                  module (knobs such as LFO depth and rate, sample solo toggle, 
                  etc). Changes in knob values are recorded into the Reason sequencer. 
                  The sequencer now becomes a kind of random access repository 
                  of controller information. The sequencer does not have to be 
                  in play mode. Instead, the playback position wiper is dragged 
                  to various locations within the sequence. </p>
                <p>These locations are meant to represent points on a time line. 
                  However, the sequencer now becomes more like a map - one can 
                  see the whole picture simultaneously, and can decide to jump 
                  from a point to any other location. One can stay at the chosen 
                  sequencer location as long as desired. The performing is now 
                  interacting with a spatial interface in time, but not bound 
                  by the time that is meant to be represented by the sequence. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  When a location is selected by positioning the play wiper, all 
                  the controller values at that location are sent to the synth 
                  and sampler modules, and the values on the mudules change. Thereby, 
                  the performer is able to instantly change the value of an unlimited 
                  number of 'knobs' (insead of only being able to turn 1 or 2 
                  knobs at a time by hand). The performer cen practice with the 
                  network in order to be familiar with the sonic changes that 
                  occur at different sequencer locations. <br>
                  <br>
                  Mixer values are also recorded into a sequencer track. So a 
                  location can also yield mutes, solos, changes in volume,send 
                  and pan position, etc.. Matrix step sequencers are also employed. 
                  The performer can press 'play' on an individual Matrix, or the 
                  whole sequence can be put into play mode (even for a few seconds), 
                  which will cause the step sequencers to play from that position, 
                  unless a control value has been programmed at that point which 
                  tells the Matrix not to play. <br>
                  <br>
                  Programmed in Reason 1.0.<br>

                  <b>BIO/STATEMENT</b> <br>
                  Marty McCavitt is an artist living in Richmond, VA. Unmarried, 
                  father of three great kids. <br>
                  <br>
                  Over the years, I have made some kind of living as a musician 
                  - played piano and sax in numerous top 40, country, soul, swing, 
                  and jazz bands. Wrote music for corporate videos and ads. Performed 
                  with Idio-Savant, The Tom and Marty Band, Famous Actors from 
                  Out of Town, Mao Amore, Jones + McCavitt and Birds in the Meadow. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I like to perform live. 99% of my creative live is spent not 
                  performing. This time is used for computer and synthesizer programming, 
                  experimenting, writing music, writing improv etudes, instrument 
                  modifications and inventions, rehearsing solo or with other 
                  musicians and recording. But my performances are generally improvised.
