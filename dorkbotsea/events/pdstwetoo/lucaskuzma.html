                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Giving voice to encroaching insecurity, the work's three 
                  movements paint a dismal picture of things to come. Powerlessness 
                  as aleatoric composition. Painstaking cutting and placing as 
                  touching glimmers of hope. Romantic scenery, cabaret cacophony, 
                  windy streets in the grey dawn light. Serene harmonious vistas 
                  give way to an atonal scourge, generative processes are set 
                  loose and reined back in. The extended vocals employed by singer 
                  Jesse Quattro lend a haunting human air to fierce mechanical 
                  churning. Andrew Kitchen's complex drum work is deconstructed 
                  and reassembled amidst robotic pulses, guidance systems, falling 
                  concrete.</p>
                <p>Custom Reaktor patches were built for granular scattering and 
                  frequency-selective delay processing. Generative MIDI processes 
                  were set up to augment human composition. The final project 
                  was mixed in Logic. <br>

                  <b>STATEMENT</b> <br>
                  Lucas Kuzma is a media artist, musician, programmer, and interaction 
                  designer. His works utilize generative systems for the production 
                  of aural and visual art, explore the confluence of sound and 
                  space, and examine data mappings between time, space, and frequency 
                  domains. He has performed live techno in Berlin, lectured on 
                  generative music in Los Angeles, had a solo show in Chinatown, 
                  and is now attempting to settle in New York. Kuzma holds a BS 
                  in Computer Science and a BA in Philosophy with an Artificial 
                  Intelligence minor from Case Western Reserve University and 
                  an MFA in Design and Media Art from UCLA. <br>
