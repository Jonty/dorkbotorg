                  DESCRIPTION/STATEMENT <br>
                  </b><i>&quot;Where Did All These Dust Bunnies Come From?&quot;</i> 
                  is an experiment with negative space in audio, approaching composition 
                  from what might be similar visually to cubism, where the perspective 
                  is distorted. With most compositions and music, there is a linear 
                  wall of sound without empty or silent spaces. Live DJs demonstrate 
                  this concept clearly by blending and weaving together a continuous 
                  audio palette. In <i>&quot;Where Did All These Dust Bunnies 
                  Come From?&quot;</i> the composition is written so it sounds 
                  as if it were stretched out like a slinky and slowed down to 
                  reveal empty spaces - negative space - between the notes, but 
                  without the effect of slow-motion morphed audio. Almost all 
                  of the notes and instruments are sounded out in real time, with 
                  quiet moments between them. The perspective of time and space 
                  has been stretched and altered, like in cubism. In <i>&quot;Where 
                  Did All These Dust Bunnies Come From?&quot;</i> there is also 
                  no real beginning or end. The recording is designed to be looped 
                  without a discernible start or endpoint, and lack obvious climaxes, 
                  resolutions or thematic developments found in most compositions. 
                  The recording was created using samples of actual instruments 
                  and Digital Performer as the sequencer. <br>
