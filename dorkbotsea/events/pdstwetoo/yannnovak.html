                  <b>BIO/STATEMENT</b> <br>
                  My objective as an artist is to create artwork that is an investigation 
                  of my response to the world. Using collage as my means of investigation 
                  I employ various sets of sounds or visual images. I deconstruct 
                  these to create something new out of my subconscious responses. 
                  I believe that through this process I will gain a deeper understanding 
                  of my means of logic and reasoning. Using this interdisciplinary 
                  approach to art, in the future I intend to explore the interaction 
                  between visual and auditory collage. <br>
                  <br>
                  Yann Novak was born in Madison, WI in 1979. At an early age, 
                  he became interested in the worlds of both music and visual 
                  art. He developed his primary medium, collage, via pieces which 
                  combined found photographs with his own drawings, and prerecorded 
                  LPs with loops and live instruments. In the 1990s, Novak performed 
                  and exhibited his work throughout the vibrant Madison caf&eacute; 
                  art scene. <br>
                  <br>
                  In 2000, Novak moved to Seattle and refined his methods, trading 
                  in found images for original photographs and watercolors, and 
                  turntables and vinyl records for a Mini Disc recorded and a 
                  laptop, in order to achieve a more in-depth style of production. 
                  Novak has released set of 5 limited edition 3-inch CDs &quot;Three 
                  Inches for Friends&quot;. In addition, he has produced two film 
                  soundtracks, for &quot;Learning&quot; (which he also produced), 
                  and &quot;Neptune&quot; (produced by Brian Murphy). Both movies 
                  premiered at the Seattle Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, in 2003 
                  and 2004, respectively. <br>
                  <br>
                  Novak's work has withstood a series of changes in method while 
                  always retaining and refining the strengths of his unique aesthetic, 
                  exploring the overlap and intersection between presence and 
                  absence, art and design, sound and music. <br>
