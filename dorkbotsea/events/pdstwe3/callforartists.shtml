Dorkbot-sea's biennial exhibition, People Doing Strange Things with Electricity, showcases innovative trends in modern art by bringing together established and emerging artists who work with electricity in a signification way either in their art, or in its creation.  In the past, over 1200 people have visited the exhibit.  			</p>							<p>				<strong>About dorkbot-sea</strong>:  dorkbot-sea is the Seattle-based spin-off of dorkbot-nyc, a monthly meeting of artists of all stripes, designers, engineers, students and other interested parties who are involved in the creation of electronic art in the broadest sense of the term. The purpose of dorkbot is to give artists and technologists an opportunity for informal peer review, establish a forum for the presentation of new artworks and technologies, help build relationships and foster collaboration between people with various backgrounds and interests, and give us all a chance to see the cool projects that our neighbors are working on.  Please see <a href="http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/">http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea</a> for more information about Seattle's dorkbot.			</p>		</div> <!-- end of first contentbox --><!-- begin exhibition goals and info contentbox -->		<div class="contentbox">					<h3>Exhibition Goals</h3>			<p>				This year, in addition to seeking works that in some way involve the use of electricity, we are emphasizing interactivity:  art installations that interact with the environment, with participant observers, and with other installations.  &quot;Strange Things&quot; that pique curiosity and inspire a desire to touch.  Our focus on interactive electronic projects encompasses a broad range of possibilities: art that borders the line between physical and digital art, digital art and experimental media, kinetic sculpture, reactive sculpture, large scale collaborations, lighting installations, web-based art, networked art, ubiquitous computing...to name a few.   Past exhibitors expressed themselves in media and disciplines as diverse as ferrofluids, surveillance technology, kinetic sculpture, sound and video installations, blown glass, living grass, patchwork, weaving, lasers and LEDs.  Please see <a href="http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/events-pdstwe2.shtml">http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/events-pdstwe2.shtml</a> for an overview of our last exhibit including a list of artists and pictures of art.			</p>						<h4>Criteria</h4>			<p>				&quot;Strange Things&quot; is a juried show of about 15-30 pieces, ranging from small wall images to full room installations.  We have several large rooms and a theatre available. The criteria on which the proposals will be judged include artistic quality; appropriateness for the exhibit; successfully addressing the goals of &quot;Strange Things&quot;: successfully addressing public safety and maintenance issues; and the ability of the artist to complete the work as described.  We reserve the right to decline any or all of the submittals. 			</p>			<h4>Selection Process</h4>			<p>				Submission selections will be made by the dorkbot-sea organizing committee.  Submissions will receive conditional acceptances in September, with final decisions made Monday in November based on likelihood of completion and timely installation.  See schedule below.  The committee may choose to solicit more information from artists in the process of making  their decisions.  The committee is comprised of the Dorkbot overlord committee including: Eric McNeill and Laura MacCary as curators/jury leads, Shelly Farnham as event producer, Eldan Goldenberg, Toby Paddock, Jeremy Kahn, Scott David, Joe Benner, Chuck Harrison, Chris Prosser, Michael Worobec, and a guest juror, Misha Neininger, executive director of 911 Media.			</p>			<h4>Eligibility</h4>			<p>				We expect that most submissions will be made by local artists in the dorkbot community, however we are open to all artists irrespective of their location as long as they use electricity as a major component of their creations and/or its display.  In past exhibits, artists reflected the diversity and inclusiveness of the global dorkbot community, encompassing established artists broadening their creative horizons, emerging artists working with new technologies and new artists with technical backgrounds exploring the artistic possibilities of their field of expertise.			</p>		</div> <!-- end of exhibition goals and info contentbox --><!-- begin schedule and costs contentbox -->		<div class="contentbox">					<h3>Exhibition Schedule</h3>						<ul>				<li><s><strong>Art proposals due:</strong> Monday, September 17, 2007</s></li>				<li><s><strong>Conditional Jury selections:</strong> Monday, October 8, 2007</s></li>				<li><strong>Final Jury selections:</strong> Monday, November 5, 2007</li>				<li><strong>Physical Installation:</strong> Monday, December 3 to Friday, December 7</li>				<li><strong>Opening Night Event:</strong> Saturday, December 8</li>				<li><strong>Exhibition Start date:</strong> Saturday, December 8</li>				<li><strong>Exhibition End date:</strong> Tuesday, January 8, 2008</li>				<li><strong>Teardown:</strong> Wednesday, January 9 through Saturday, January 13</li>			</ul>						<h4>Costs for Artists</h4>			<p>				Artists will be expected to cover their own transportation and installation costs.
