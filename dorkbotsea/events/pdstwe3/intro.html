					<strong>About &quot;Strange Things&quot;:</strong>

					<img src="pix/scottdavid1.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5ex; border: 3px double #dc7731;" width="210" height="154" />
					New and exciting genres of art emerge as artists, scientists and technologists bring together their expertise to push the boundaries of what is possible. <a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/">Dorkbot-sea</a>'s exhibition, People Doing Strange Things with Electricity, showcases innovative trends in modern art by bringing together established and emerging artists who work with electricity in a significant way either in their art, or in its creation. For the last show in 2005, over 1200 people visited the exhibit during the opening night event. Please see <a href="http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/events-pdstwe2.shtml">this page</a> for an overview of our last exhibit including a list of artists, and <a href="images.html">here</a> for pictures.

					This year, in addition to showcasing works that in some way involve the use of electricity, we are emphasizing interactivity: art installations that interact with the environment, with participant observers, and with other installations. &quot;<a href="index.html">Strange Things</a>&quot; that pique curiosity and inspire a desire to touch.  The Dorkbot Overlord Committee, with guest juror Misha Neininger, Executive Director of <a href="http://911media.org/">911 Media Arts Center</a>, selected over 25 pieces from regional artists.  Our focus on interactive electronic projects encompasses a broad range of creative media: art that borders the line between physical and digital art, digital art and experimental media, kinetic sculpture, reactive sculpture, sound and light installations, web-based art, ubiquitous computing...to name a few.
