              <p>Reiquam is a Seattle artist whose work ranges from prints and 
                drawings to sculptural furniture, mechanical sculptures and public 
                art projects. He earned his B.F.A. in sculpture from the University 
                of Washington in 1982 and his M.F.A. in sculpture from Yale University 
                in 1984. He was employed as the Head Technician and Head of the 
                Sculpture Department at Pratt Fine Arts Center for over ten years. 
                Reiquam served six years as a commissioner on the King County 
                Public Art Commission and has taught sculpture at Pratt Fine Arts 
                Center, Cornish College of the Arts and the University of Washington 
                School of Art. He recently joined a group of Seattle area artists 
                in a new public art mentorship program at the City of Seattle&#146;s 
                Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs (formerly Seattle Arts Commission) 
                to assist emerging artists in the development of their first public 
                art projects. In addition to the production of his own artwork, 
                Reiquam&#146;s business, New Art Projects Company specializes
