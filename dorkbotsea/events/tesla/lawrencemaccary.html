              <p><b>STATEMENT: A PACKRAT'S PLAN FOR ART</b></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Be a collector. I started very young and had trouble with 
                the Borough of Roselle Park, N.J. The place was an eclectic mix 
                of houses, farms, factories, railroad yards, a county dump and 
                a park. The dump was a few blocks from our house and was a virtual 
                mine of good stuff for a kid. The Borough set up a trash collection 
                service for the homeowners and to that end hired an Italian farmer 
                with a horse-drawn manure wagon to collect the stuff. When the 
                wagon was filled, he would haul the contents to the dump. One 
                day came a loud knock on our back door and Mr. Adase, the Italian 
                farmer, holds up a large metal pipe with flexible metal hose attached 
                and says to my mother, &quot;Lady, three times I haula away this 
                hunka junk from your house and I do it again but this is last 
                time&quot;. Another time Mom was walking the dog on the road past 
                the dump and someone up on the railroad track hollers &quot;Hey 
                kid, picking any chunk?' Yep, it was me again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) See the hidden art in found objects. Once in Aspen, I saw 
                a knight welded up from old auto parts and that got me going. 
                I first studied blacksmithing and bought a coal-fired forge to 
                heat and bend metal. Next I learned gas and arc welding at a vocational 
                school in Boulder and began to inhabit junkyards and auto wrecking 
                yards to look for neat stuff. When I retired and moved to Spokane 
                I found the time to collect things and begin putting art projects 
                together. One of my favorites was a pterodactyl made of steel 
                plate, rebar, and part of a sewer auger. Someone else must have 
                liked it too because one night persons unknown climbed up to the 
                porch eaves and cut it down with bolt cutters. Pictures of it 
                were shown on local TV but it never was found.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Be open and try new art forms. When Laura presented me with 
                two coils she wove on a loom and wondered what could be done with 
                them, I wondered too. After several measurements on a Q meter 
                and an impedance bridge, I had the answer. They could be used 
                in the tuned circuits of a Theremin. People like me, who build 
                electronic things from scratch, must be serious collectors of 
                components found at flea markets, garage sales, auctions, estate 
                sales, and going out of business sales. Just about all the parts 
                needed for Laura's Theremin came out of my junk box.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Be a collaborator. It is fun and rewarding to work with someone 
                on an art project because they bring different values and ideas 
                into the mix. One person does not have all the answers and really 
                needs another for input and help to bring things together. Artists 
                tend to be loners but some projects are so diverse and rely on 
                so many different skills and talents that collaboration may be 
                the only way to successful completion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Think young. Old as I am, I try to understand the view point 
                of artists who are so much younger than I. They have ideas that 
                would never occur to me and at first I may unimpressed but then, 
                when I look more closely, I begin to get an inkling of what they 
                want to do and become enthusiastic and really excited about their 
                skill and the beauty of their art.</p>
