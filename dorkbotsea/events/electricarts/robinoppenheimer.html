                <p>At the beginning of the Twenty-first Century, the use of electricity-based 
                  technologies in art-making practices is as ubiquitous as the 
                  use of paintbrushes or a chisel. We live in an immersive, super-saturated 
                  media environment where electric current is as essential to 
                  our existence as oxygen or running water, and today's artists 
                  take electricity and the vast array of tools it powers for granted 
                  as a basic part of their creative toolbox. How has it happened 
                  that these electric media tools have become so accessible and 
                  acceptable in the artworld? And what can we learn from the artists 
                  who pioneered their usage in the last century?</p>
                <p>Twentieth Century art history is filled with myriad stories 
                  of artists using electricity-based mechanical and communications 
                  technologies such as film (still and motion picture), audio, 
                  video, and computers. Starting with the inventions of photography, 
                  telephone, audio, and other communications-based technologies 
                  at the end of the 19th century, artists have always been early 
                  adopters and experimenters of the &quot;new&quot; technologies 
                  of their times, discovering and propagating creative, more humane 
                  uses for man-made machines. This document and accompanying screening 
                  will present a snapshot of key multimedia artists and artworks 
                  from the Big Bang collision of art and technology in the Twentieth 
                  Century - the 1960s - when all the key communications technologies 
                  first became accessible as art making tools. The selection of 
                  six archival films and videos presents an audiovisual spectrum 
                  of new ideas and technology-infused artworks created by a community 
                  of visionary artists who mostly lived and worked in New York 
                  City during that tumultuous and transformational decade.</p>
                <p>Major early Twentieth Century art movements that first utilized 
                  electrical communications technologies include Dada, Surrealism, 
                  Constructivism, Futurism, and the Bauhaus. These revolutionary 
                  movements that focused on the complex relationships between 
                  art, technology and human consciousness were originated mostly 
                  by European artists, many of whom later came to America as political 
                  refugees of the two World Wars. Exiled artists and teachers 
                  Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, Marcel Duchamp, Arnold Schoenberg 
                  and many others taught at schools that included the Chicago 
                  Art Institute, Yale University, and the seminal Black Mountain 
                  College in North Carolina. They passed their new ideas and artworks 
                  on to young, receptive American artists who had grown up in 
                  the postwar conformity of a prosperous middle-class consumer 
                  culture.</p>
                <p>Many of these young artists started out as painters who rejected 
                  the narrow forms and precepts of the established art world. 
                  They rebelled against Abstract Expressionism, which emphasized 
                  the solitary, inner life of the artist. They chose not to work 
                  in isolation, but in a more collective and collaborative mode 
                  as they experimented with newly accessible multimedia art forms 
                  and technologies, including new postwar inventions like portable 
                  film cameras, carousel slide projectors, and lightweight audio 
                  recorders. They broke down the traditional artist stereotypes 
                  and boundaries between art forms and art and life, and began 
                  to question and explore the predominant mass media environment 
                  transmitted by the communications media technologies of radio, 
                  telephone, cinema, and television. </p>
                <p>The early 60s were also an expansive time for science and technology 
                  when anything seemed possible, even going to the moon. With 
                  the Russian Sputnik-induced Space Race at full throttle, science 
                  and technology were valorized and seen as the epitome of American 
                  initiative and know-how. Critic Susan Sontag articulated a &quot;new 
                  sensibility&quot; of connecting technology to the arts in &quot;Against 
                  Interpretation&quot; written in 1961:</p>

                  <p><i>What gives literature its preeminence is its heavy burden 
                    of 'content.' Both reportage and moral judgment&#133;But the 
                    model arts of our time are actually those with much less content, 
                    and a much cooler mode of moral judgment - like music, films, 
                    dance, architecture, painting, sculpture. The practice of 
                    these arts - all of which draw profusely, naturally, and without 
                    embarrassment, upon science and technology - are the locus 
                    of the new sensibility. In fact there can be no divorce between 
                    science and technology, on the one hand, and art, on the other, 
                    any more than there can be a divorce between art and the forms 
                    of social life.</i> [1] </p>

                  up with, young artists such as Robert Rauschenberg (born in 
                  Port Arthur, Texas), Trisha Brown (Aberdeen, WA), Andy Warhol 
                  (Pittsburgh), Allan Kaprow (Atlantic City), Bob Dylan (Hibbing, 
                  MN), and many, many others migrated to the same small urban 
                  village in New York City - Greenwich Village - where they could 
                  work and live on very little money. Greenwich Village, with 
                  its notorious bohemian history of artistic and political fervor, 
                  became Ground Zero in the late 1950s and early 1960s for artists 
                  from such disparate places and disciplines as painting, sculpture, 
                  modern dance, film, poetry, and folk music to meet, socialize, 
                  exchange ideas, and work together collectively on large multi-media 
                  events and performances. Dancers Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, 
                  Deborah Hay, and Lucinda Childs all studied and danced together, 
                  and began producing mixed-media dance pieces with other artists 
                  at the progressive Judson Church on Washington Square. They 
                  danced for Merce Cunningham and also took John Cage's composition 
                  class at the New School, where they met other artists like Robert 
                  Rauschenberg, Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins, and Robert Whitman. 
                  Their performances were attended mostly by fellow artists and 
                  musicians such as Andy Warhol, Robert Morris, Nam June Paik 
                  and many others who often helped out or performed with them.</p>

                  <p><i>&#133;The country's postwar mood of pragmatism was reflected 
                    in the various arts, from the Happenings that made use of 
                    environments at hand, to the New Realism, or Pop Art depiction 
                    of figures and objects and making reference to industrial 
                    subjects and styles. The economy was expanding, and the new 
                    Kennedy administration stressed youth, art, and culture. There 
                    were few grants for individual dancers, but there was a spirit 
                    of willing participation and an interest in using inexpensive 
                    materials; one could live cheaply and make art cheaply. The 
                    Greenwich Village beatnik culture had catalyzed a renaissance 
                    of a 'bohemia' that had long been the reputation of the neighborhood. 
                    The area was an intensive center of theatrical, literary, 
                    and artistic activities and ideas that spread freely and flowed 
                    from one art form to another. The philosophical fascinations 
                    with Zen Buddhism, existentialism, and phenomenology fit well 
                    with certain aspects of American art in the late 1950s and 
                    early 1960s. The concreteness of existence, the interest in 
                    the everyday actions people practice, the questions of identity, 
                    both individual and collective, that were the topics of these 
                    philosophical systems - at least in their popular versions 
                    - were appropriate questions for modernist artists after the 
                    middle of the twentieth century. &#133;Poetry, music, theater, 
                    and dance stressed performance more than the literary aspect 
                    of their forms, aspiring to more immediacy, more 'presentness,' 
                    more concrete experience. &#133;If the Village was a place 
                    where artists and intellectuals gathered to partake of the 
                    diversity and community spirit that gathering created, and 
                    to pursue a new identity that could only be formed in such 
                    a community, it was also the place where they examined the 
                    identities of those arts, working at the edges of artistic 
                    conventions and analyzing the process of making that art.</i>

                <p>The late 1950s and early 60s was an optimistic, utopian time 
                  in the arts when artists questioned and often transcended traditional 
                  art forms like painting, dance, music and theater, exploring 
                  new ways of making art by incorporating the materials of the 
                  &quot;new&quot; technologies of the day. This is a technology-based 
                  art history rich in visionary ideas, artists and multiple art 
                  movements such as Happenings, Fluxus, Expanded Cinema, Underground 
                  Film, Pop Art, Conceptual Art, New Dance, and New Music that 
                  planted the conceptual and technological seeds for today's electronic-based 
                  multimedia processes and art forms. It is also a history mostly 
                  hidden and often ignored by traditional art historians and educators. 
                </p>
                <p>Underground, or experimental filmmaking, flourished after World 
                  War II with the invention of relatively inexpensive, portable 
                  cameras and sound recorders. Filmmakers such as Stan Vanderbeek, 
                  Jud Yalkut, Ronald Nameth, and Robert Breer used Happenings 
                  and other multimedia events and festivals occurring around them 
                  as subject matter for their own experimental films. Breer, who 
                  was initially a sculptor, had met Swiss machine artist Jean 
                  Tinguely when they were in a group show of postwar kinetic art 
                  called &quot;Le Mouvement&quot; in Paris in 1955. Tinguely was 
                  part of an earlier generation of European artists called &quot;The 
                  New Realists&quot; who included Yves Klein and Christo. He declared 
                  that &quot;life is movement,&quot; and &quot;everything transforms 
                  itself, everything modifies itself ceaselessly, and to try to 
                  check life in mid-flight and recapture it in the form of a work 
                  of art, a sculpture or a painting, seems to me a mockery of 
                  the intensity of life.&quot;[3] The New Realists preferred blatant 
                  commercial-industrial materials and imagery that was a prelude 
                  to the tide of technologically-oriented art that swept through 
                  Europe and the U.S. in the early 1960s. </p>
                <p>When Tinguely came to New York City in 1960, he enlisted the 
                  help of Breer and Billy Kluver, a neighbor of Breer's who was 
                  a Swedish-born laser systems engineer working for Bell Laboratories. 
                  Kluver assisted Tinguely in building his infamous auto-destructive 
                  &quot;Hommage to New York&quot; kinetic, or movement-based, 
                  sculpture. &quot;Hommage&quot; was a massive assemblage of wheels, 
                  airplane parts and other junk that screeched, whirred, and otherwise 
                  was in constant motion. Breer filmed the assembling and the 
                  subsequent public performance of the artwork, including an unanticipated 
                  fire, in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art on 
                  March 17, 1960.</p>
                <p>During that event, Billy Kluver met Robert Rauschenberg, who 
                  later asked Kluver to help create a series of five sculptures 
                  called &quot;Oracle&quot; that made sounds when photocells were 
                  activated by observers in the gallery space. Rauschenberg, in 
                  turn, introduced Kluver to his circle of artist-friends who 
                  included Merce Cunningham, John Cage, Robert Whitman, Jasper 
                  Johns, Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenberg, and Simone Forti Whitman, 
                  who was part of the collective of dancers known as the Judson 
                  Dance Theater mentioned above. Kluver began working with many 
                  of these artists to help them create Happenings and technology-based 
                  artworks, multi-media performances and theatrical pieces, giving 
                  him first-hand insight into the collaborative process that was 
                  possible between artists and engineers who came from different 
                  worlds. </p>
                <p>Kluver and Rauschenberg produced a landmark series of technology-based 
                  performances in the 69th Regiment Armory in October, 1966 called 
                  &quot;9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering.&quot; This large-scale 
                  collaborative event, with Bell Labs engineers designing new 
                  uses for technologies such as infrared video and wireless radio 
                  transmitters for ten Greenwich Village-based artists (John Cage, 
                  Robert Whitman, Yvonne Rainer, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, David 
                  Tudor, Oyvind Fahlstrom, Lucinda Childs, Alex Hay and Rauschenberg), 
                  convinced Kluver and Rauschenberg to form an organization called 
                  Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T) in 1967 to help other 
                  artists meet and work collaboratively with engineers. </p>
                <p>&quot;Variations V,&quot; a multi-media dance performance film 
                  recorded by German television in 1966, was a forerunner of the 
                  '9 Evenings' performances. It was choreographed by Merce Cunningham, 
                  with music by John Cage, films by Stan Vanderbeek, TV images 
                  by Nam June Paik, and engineering by Kluver and his Bell Labs 
                  colleagues. It is representative of the historic community created 
                  by the mixing of artforms and technologies, and the collaborative 
                  coming together of the rarefied worlds of art and engineering

                  electronic poles placed around the stage. The sound is triggered 
                  by the dancer's movements and then altered or delayed by the 
                  musicians. Filmmaker Stan Vanderbeek recorded rehearsals of 
                  the dancers and then overlayed this footage as well as other 
                  stock footage images in the final film. Composer Nam June Paik 
                  projected these images on television screens during the performance. 
                  Non-dance related activities were also performed. Merce Cunningham 
                  potted a large plant and Carolyn Brown repotted it. The plant 
                  had a microphone attached to it so that any movement would produce 
                  sound. At the end of the piece, Merce Cunningham rode a bicycle 
                  through the space.&quot; [4] </p>
                <p>John Cage was the lead artist/composer of &quot;Variations 
                  V,&quot; collaborating with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, 
                  media artists, and engineers. &quot;He and David Tudor settled 
                  on two systems for the sound to be affected by movement. For 
                  the first, Billy Kluver and his colleagues set up a system of 
                  directional photocells aimed at the stage lights, so that the 
                  dancers triggered sounds as they cut the light beams with their 
                  movements. A second system used a series of antennas. When a 
                  dancer came within four feet of an antenna a sound would result. 
                  Ten photocells were wired to activate tape-recorders and short-wave 
                  radios. Cecil Coker designed a control circuit, which was built 
                  by assistant Witt Wittnebert. Film footage by Stan Vanderbeek 
                  and Nam June Paik's manipulated television images were projected 
                  on screens behind the dancers. The photocells were located at 
                  the base of the five-foot antennas placed around the stage. 
                  Cage, Tudor, and Gordon Mumma operated equipment to modify and 
                  determine the final sounds.&quot; [5] </p>
                <p>In 1962, another group of artists and engineers formed a collective 
                  called the Us Company, or USCO, in an abandoned church just 
                  north of New York City. As Douglas Davis described them, &quot;The 
                  'US Company'&#133;set up shop - plus a permanent environmental 
                  light display - in an abandoned Garnerville, New York, church. 
                  Including artists, engineers, poets, and filmmakers, USCO mixed 
                  film, tapes, slides, and light in its audiovisual performances, 
                  each in strong, unmodulated quantities&#133;. USCO's leaders 
                  were strongly influenced by McLuhan's ideas as expressed in 
                  his book 'Understanding Media.' Their environments - performed 
                  in galleries, churches, schools, and museums across the United 
                  States - increased in complexity with time, culminating in multiscreen 
                  audiovisual 'worlds' and strobe environments. They saw technology 
                  as a means of bringing people together in a new and sophisticated 
                  tribalism. In pursuit of that ideal, they lived, worked, and 
                  created together in virtual anonymity. 'We are all one,' the 
                  group declared in a statement in the 'Kunst Licht Kunst' catalogue, 
                  'beating the tribal drum of our new electronic environment.'&quot; 
                  [6] </p>
                <p>Gerd Stern, one of the three founders of USCO, was born in 
                  1928 in Germany and came to America in 1936 with his family 
                  to escape Hitler. His diverse life experiences encapsulate some 
                  of the wide-ranging popular culture and art movements of the 
                  1960s, which include writing Beat poetry in San Francisco, being 
                  a manager for micro-tonal composer Harry Partch, and writing 
                  about travel for Playboy magazine. Greatly influenced by the 
                  ideas of Marshall McLuhan, he and the other members of USCO 
                  defined the term &quot;Intermedia&quot; as being &quot;the simultaneous 
                  use of various media to create a total environment experience 
                  for the audience. Meaning is communicated, not by coding ideas 
                  into abstract literary language, but by creating an emotionally 
                  real experience through the use of audio-visual technology. 
                  Originally conceived in the realm of art rather than in science 
                  or engineering, the principles on which intermedia is based 
                  are grounded in the fields of psychology, information theory, 
                  and communication engineering.&quot;[7] </p>
                <p>Stan Vanderbeek is another visionary artist who embraced the 
                  new technologies of film, video, and computers. &quot;A pioneer 
                  in the development of experimental film and live-action animation 
                  technique, Vanderbeek achieved widespread recognition in the 
                  American avant-garde cinema. An advocate of the application 
                  of a utopian fusion of art and technology, he began making films 
                  in 1955. In the 1960s, he produced theatrical, multimedia pieces 
                  and computer animation, often working in collaboration with 
                  Bell Telephone Laboratories. In the 1970s, he constructed a 
                  'Movie-Drome' in Stony Point, New York, which was an audiovisual 
                  laboratory for the projection of film, dance, magic theater, 
                  sound and other visual effects. His multimedia experiments included 
                  movie murals, projection systems, planetarium events and the 
                  exploration of early computer graphics and image-processing 
                  systems&quot; [8] that were the precursors of Virtual Reality 
                  and other immersive digital environments. Gloria Sutton describes 
                  Vanderbeek's backyard Movie-Drome as a new type of experiential 
                  multi-image artwork in &quot;Future Cinema:&quot; </p>

                    theater,' and the 'visual boundaries' of painting and sculpture, 
                    Vanderbeek sought a medium that would move beyond optical

                <p>Vanderbeek, making art with the advanced media of his day, 
                  foresaw the coming of the Internet as he explored the teachings 
                  of McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller through his multimedia projections 
                  in his Movie-Drome. He envisioned a distribution network of 
                  similar domed structures that connected audiences around the 
                  world to a universal audio-visual language composed of sound, 
                  images, and movement through time and space. He conjectured 
                  that &quot;in the future, a similar Movie-Drome could receive 
                  its images by satellite from a worldwide library source, store 
                  them and program a feedback presentation to the local community. 
                  Dialogues with other centers would be likely, and instant reference 
                  material via transmission television and telephone could be

<p>As an artist-in-residence and instructor at MIT, Vanderbeek 
                  also created early computer art in an effort to get as close 
                  as possible to the functioning of the human nervous system. 
                  &quot;For the artist, moving into the area of computers is extending 
                  his mind with a tool technically as responsive as himself,&quot; 
                  Vanderbeek said. &quot;To think about his work is, for the artist, 
                  doing his work. An abstract notation system for making movies 
                  and image storage and retrieval systems open a door to a kind 
                  of mental attitude of movie-making&#133;the artist is no longer 
                  restricted to the exact execution of the form; so long as he 
                  is clear in his mind as to what he wants, eventually he can 
                  realize his movie or work on a computer somewhere. Technology 
                  becomes the amplifier for the human imagination.&quot; [12] 
                </p>
                <p>Vanderbeek was also part of a first generation of artists who 
                  began to explore and gain access to television and the &quot;new&quot; 
                  portable video technology pioneered by Sony in the mid-sixties 
                  with the introduction of their &frac12;&quot; reel-to-reel Portapak 
                  video recorder. For the first time, artists were able to explore 
                  the new properties of video, with its ability to record and 
                  play back images in real time that was uniquely different from 
                  film. Up until the invention of the Portapak, artists could 
                  only examine TV from the outside, playing with the image on 
                  the TV screen or treating the TV console like a piece of sculpture. 
                  By the late sixties, artists were producing a wide range of 
                  video art tapes that included experimental single-channel tapes, 
                  social issues documentaries, multi-channel video installations, 
                  and video documents of live performances. </p>
                <p>From 1960 to 1970, Howard Wise founded a gallery in New York 
                  City that presented the full spectrum of electricity-based art 
                  forms of that decade, ranging from kinetic art to multimedia 
                  works that explored the nexus of art and technology. According 
                  to Electronic Arts Intermix, a video distribution organization 
                  that Wise founded in 1971, &quot;The gallery featured several 
                  groundbreaking exhibitions that included&#133; the landmark 
                  1969 'TV as a Creative Medium.' The first exhibition dedicated 
                  to video (or television) in the United States, 'TV as a Creative 
                  Medium' included artists such as Nam June Paik, Charlotte Moorman, 
                  and Aldo Tambellini. In addition to defining an emerging artistic 
                  movement, this influential exhibition revealed the need for 
                  new paradigms to support artists working in video&#133;.Prescient 
                  in its diversity, the exhibition featured performance, objects, 
                  closed-circuit installations, with works as varied as Paik and 
                  Moorman's 'TV Bra for Living Sculpture,' Schneider's 'Wipe Cycle' 
                  and Thomas Tadlock's 'Archetron.' As with other revolutions, 
                  'TV as a Creative Medium' was both the grand finale of an idea 
                  - the kinetic art movement of the 1960s - and an indication 
                  of the future - the impact of video and television in the hands 
                  of artists.&quot; [13]</p>
                <p>By viewing a sampling of historic films and videos that represent 
                  a continuum of artists' uses of electricity-based machines and 
                  technologies in the 1960s, one can see the rapidly expanding 
                  exploration of media-based technologies by artists. Starting 
                  with Tinguely's auto-destructive kinetic sculptures made out 
                  of old machines and other man-made materials at the beginning 
                  of the decade, we move quickly to a multimedia dance and music 
                  performance in 1965 where artists and engineers worked together 
                  as collaborators to explore and integrate new uses for more 
                  sophisticated media technologies like television and wireless 
                  transmitters that were core elements of the artwork. USCO's 
                  uses of technologies such as strobes, slide and film projectors, 
                  and audiotapes attempted to create a more holistic, interactive 
                  environment designed to alter the audience's perceptions and 
                  consciousness. Stan Vanderbeek, with his prophetic call for 
                  the development of a universal picture language, experimented 
                  with the expansion of the media space itself in his Movie-Drome, 
                  combining film, video, slides, music and live performance in 
                  an immersive physical space. He also explored the new creative 
                  space of computer graphics. And when portable video became accessible 
                  in the late 60s, artists began to more fully explore the pervasive 
                  media landscape and its relationship to human consciousness 
                  through the use of video as communication, alternative television 
                  content, and as a transformer of awareness and physical spaces. 
                  Artists moved quickly from making objects to raising consciousness 
                  in the span of ten years, and electric media-based technologies 
                  were the tools that made the beginnings of this continuing mind-bending 
                  transformational artmaking process possible. </p>
