                <p>This original archive film and video footage shows the <b>first 
                  artists</b> to work with technologies that we consider 'modern' 
                  today, such as infra-red cameras, contact microphones, television, 
                  sensors, video and beyond. With these technologies, and in collaboration 
                  with engineers such as Bell Labs's Billy Kluver, we watch as 
                  the artists create, exhibit and perform work that is radical 
                  in scope and execution even in 2005. This evening represents 
                  a unique opportunity for local audiences as the material Robin 
                  Oppenheimer has researched and located is very rarely available 
                  for viewing by the general public.</p>
