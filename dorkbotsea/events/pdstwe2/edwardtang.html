                  <b>DESCRIPTION </b><br>
                  Concept developed in collaboration with Jeanne Strole.<br>
                  &quot;Threads://Porn_Personals.html&quot; is a hybrid software 
                  work intended for live installation or as a rendered video presentation. 
                  This work combines an edited video clip from a adult film, live 
                  content from the World Wide Web, and 3D graphics programming 
                  techniques to illuminate some forms of pyschosexual and social 
                  behavior in very particular online communities. When the software 
                  is run, it connects like a web browser to &quot;male seeking 
                  female&quot; personals sections of a community website and downloads 
                  the page. These personals are often inappropriately sexually 
                  suggestive as men unrealistically seek out sexual partners. 
                  The software specifically parses out the headlines of the personals 
                  from the downloaded page. The video is played back within the 
                  software and analyzed pixel by pixel for color information. 
                  This information is mapped out on a plane of three dimensional 
                  spectrum of virtual light, abstracting the image and turning 
                  it into a onscreen sculptural form. The software detects the 
                  motion of sexual intercourse within the adult video clip. From 
                  the areas of most intense human sexual activity emerge the text 
                  of the personal headlines. As the software runs, the text of 
                  the personal headlines oscillates around the movement of the 
                  bodies in the video clip. The viewers of the output of the piece 
                  experience the blending of the often salacious and prurient 
                  text and a visual representation of the desires and fantasies 
                  constructing the image behind those words.<b> <br>
