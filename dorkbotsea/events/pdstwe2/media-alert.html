                <p>At the closing event for this year's dorkbot-sea <b>People 
                  Doing Strange Things With Electricity II</b> exhibition, held 
                  at Center on Contemporary Art (CoCA) from January 22nd to March 
                  4th, special guest Professor <b>Shawn Brixey</b>, founder and 
                  Associate Director of the University of Washington's Center 
                  for Digital Arts and Experimental Media (DXArts), presented 
                  the <b>2005 dorkbotsea Peoples' Choice Award</b> to San Francisco-based 
                  artist <a href="http://www.livingindustries.com" target="_blank"><b>Ryan 
                  Wolfe</b></a> for his winning work, <b><a href="events/pdstwe2/ryanwolfe.html" onClick="javascript:window.open(this.href,'popup','width=550,height=525,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no'); return false;">Sketch

                  by dorkbotsea members, and is intended to assist the recipient 
                  in continuing to explore art that uses technology.</p>
                <p>The winner of the 2005 dorkbotsea Peoples' Choice Award was 
                  determined by votes cast by gallery visitors during the 5-week 
                  run of the exhibition. Ryan Wolfe's eloquent, evocative work 
                  won over a quarter of the total number of votes, with the remainder 
                  being split between the other 34 works in the exhibition. Runners 
                  up included Los Angeles-based OdescO (Ocean Design Collaborative)'s 
                  '<b>Nanocity</b>', and local artists Eric McNeill's '<b>Untitled: 
                  Portrait/Movement</b>', John Bain's '<b>Cubist Mirror</b>' and 
                  SID, Inc.'s '<b>Disassembly Line</b>'.</p>

                  and most successful exhibition at CoCA in over 5 years, with 
                  over 1500 people attending the opening celebration and CD launch 
                  event at CoCA, a further 400 attending the after-party at ConWorks, 
                  and record numbers of visitors to the exhibition through its 
                  close. </p>
                <p><b>More About the Artist and Sketch of a Field of Grass</b></p>
                <p>&quot;<b>Sketch Of A Field Of Grass, Pacific Coast, 2004</b> 
                  explores the idea that a memorable time, place or experience 
                  can be condensed in a singular, physical object that embodies 
                  the essential qualities of that experience. It is one in a series 
                  of sketches that encapsulate the experience of watching the 
                  rise and fall of a summer breeze across a field in a single 
                  blade of grass (or a series of blades of grass). The sketch 
                  exhibited in Seattle comprises 8 blades of grass. Each blade 
                  is a complete computational system with the ability to sense 
                  and respond to its environment. A simple networking protocol 
                  is used to propagate wind data down the network, blade by blade. 
                  Just as in a real field, each blade responds to the wind in 
                  a slightly different way. Each blade is both physically distinct 
                  and simultaneously part of a larger aggregate phenomenon. The 
                  emergent behavior that comes from the interrelation of independent 
                  nodal behavior interpreted in a group context is fundamental 
                  to the overall aesthetic effect.&quot; (Ryan Wolfe) </p>
