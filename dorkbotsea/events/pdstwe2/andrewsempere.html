                  and hardware, <br>

                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>A pot of ordinary living grass rests on a glass-topped box, 
                  underlit by a soft purple glow. People are encouraged to touch 
                  the grass, and as they do so notice that the color of the glow 
                  changes from purple to blue and eventually to bright green. 
                  The grass is happy! Complimenting the color changing light is 
                  an animated display. Along the bottom of the display is a scope-like 
                  indication of how long the grass has been in contact with a 
                  human. Above this display is an anthropomorphic animation of 
                  the grass - the face on the animation becomes happier the more 
                  the grass is touched! <br>
                  <br>
                  I believe in building authentic objects. GrassHappy works as 
                  advertised. I hope you have fun playing with the grass, take 
                  the opportunity to think about how it feels to touch grass, 
                  and to think about the fact that grass is alive. At the same 
                  time, I hope that you wonder: isn't this all just a bit silly? 
                  Computation these days is ubiquitous. It is fast, cheap and 
                  embedded in everything. The trend continues with the assumption 
                  that by embedding computation in everyday objects we increase 
                  usefulness, efficiency, productivity and ultimately: quality 
                  of life. As with any technology, just because we can doesn't 
                  mean we should! Technology allows us to explore some amazing 
                  spaces, but it should not be taken for granted that a computational 
                  intermediary increases understanding (even across species). 
                  This piece uses capacitive sensing (detecting the electrical 
                  force of a living body) to express the emotion of a plant (a 
                  strange thing to do). It relies on the fact that all living 
                  creatures, plant and animal, carry electrical current. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Andrew Sempere is an artist who often works with technology, 
                  a graphic designer, software developer and an education researcher. 
                  Andrew holds a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago 
                  and a Masters in Science from MIT, as well as a second place 
                  ribbon in the Junior Olympics for floor tumbling, an award acquired 
                  when he was in 3rd grade (and having much to do with the fact 
                  that he was the second guy to actually attempt a routine). Andrew's 
                  floor tumbling career went nowhere, but since co-founding the 
                  Tangentlab Art Collective (of Jackal Project fame), Andrew has 
                  been teaching, talking and writing about art and technology 
                  with various degrees of success. <br>
