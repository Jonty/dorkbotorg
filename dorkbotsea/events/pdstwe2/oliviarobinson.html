                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>'Imbalanced Ambivalence' is an interactive video sculpture 
                  made up of an LCD screen imbedded in an antique box with an 
                  attached small crank. When the viewer turns the crank on the 
                  box, a video fades into the LCD screen. The video is shot using 
                  a tiny camera and captures unusual angles of a woman dressing 
                  in a nurse's uniform. As she dresses, small clips of the patient 
                  who is waiting are spliced in. Because of the placement of the 
                  camera, at times the images become abstract. The playback of 
                  the video is linked to the crank which gives the impression 
                  that the viewer is actually turning the frames of the video 
                  as old film reels may have worked. When the crank stops moving 
                  the video fades out and will start again at the beginning the 
                  next time it is manipulated. My own accordion music is the soundtrack 
                  to the video. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>I adopted a feral kitten from a librarian at school, thinking 
                  feral meant the same as stray. She was not like any other cat 
                  I had met before -- a ball of hissing, scratching, hiding fur. 
                  I brought her home and I named her Pearl. Everyday for the next 
                  two weeks, I located her new hiding place, checked if she had 
                  eaten, and tried to interact without getting attacked. Just 
                  at the point I thought this was a big mistake I dangled a string 
                  in front of Pearl and she came out of her hiding place. This 
                  string made her forget that I was a stranger and gave us a way 
                  to be together. I think art making is like the string. <br>
                  <br>
                  I have worked with a variety of mediums and situations -- photography, 
                  video, inflatable sculpture, performance, community art, collaborative 
                  art, solo art -- and continually return to this story about 
                  the string. Trying new mediums and technology distracts me enough 
                  to experience a new side of myself and build relationships. 
                  I often think of myself as a craftsperson rather than artist 
                  because I love processes like measuring, then cutting and measuring 
                  again. <br>
                  <br>
                  My most recent projects merge the highly technical with the 
                  deeply personal. I incorporate sculpture, video, technology 
                  and human interaction through touching, cranking or shaking. 
                  An example is Oblivious, an interactive video installation. 
                  An image of a naked man is projected onto a touch sensitive 
                  table and as the image is touched by viewers, the man reacts 
                  physically as well as fades over multiple interactions. Through 
                  developing the technology, my string, I learned a great deal 
                  about relationships. <br>
