                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>S. R. I. is a grounding system based upon the sense of touch. 
                  It acts as a surrogate sense of touch in the absence of the 
                  artist. The piece is simultaneously exploring its surroundings 
                  and interacting with the viewer by moving and producing light/sound. 
                  It grounds me as the artist through the action of touching both 
                  the physical world and the metaphorical world of human awareness. 
                  It has become my experience that no sense does more to connect 
                  me to reality than touch. By touching I can extend myself past 
                  the world of assumption that sight seems to provide and extend 
                  myself into actual knowledge on the nature of a substance or 
                  area; such as whether or not it is hard, soft, or rough. Touch 
                  can also emphasize my awareness of the actual presence of other 
                  humans. <br>
                  <br>
                  Tactile sensation is the sense in my opinion that shows the 
                  most emotion between humans. Although violence and expressions 
                  of sentiment can be made through other means; no form of expression 
                  seems to express better than those that include the act of actual 
                  contact. I see S. R. I. as a prosthesis or extension of myself 
                  that better allows me to stay within that realm (actual, not 
                  dreamed or imagined, reality) and express my opinions on the 
                  nature of touch. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>As an artist it has become my desire to explore the various 
                  forms of human interaction and the human condition as a whole. 
                  My plan is to do this through the medium of machines. Machines, 
                  along with having the ability to act out performances in the 
                  absence of human performers, are to me an inherent part of human 
                  existence. We are integrally linked to our technology and it 
                  to us. These creatures or children that I create serve to help 
                  me explore aspects of my own life and the lives of others that 
                  I don't fully understand and feel like I need to express to 
                  other people. The themes in this exploration will range from 
                  sensuality and sentimentality to violence to the basic biological 
                  needs such as eating and sleeping. As actors my pieces will 
                  continuously perform their established tasks to properly express 
                  my concerns and lines of query. <br>
                  <br>
                  The question as to why I do not use human actors to do the work 
                  is answered by the inherent nature of machines as tools without 
                  the ability to bring in external influence or personal expression 
                  that is carried by all beings with individuality ( though this 
                  may change sometime in the near future). The machines are extensions 
                  of myself and slave to my will as far as nature and physics 
                  will allow; something that ethically I could not ask of other 
                  people. If the nature of machine existence were to change so 
                  would my viewpoint on the purpose and place of my pieces. I 
                  do not mean that there is no emotional connection between me 
                  and my art. This cannot be because of my belief. If I had no 
                  feeling for them I would have no feeling for myself since they 
                  are me and I them. As of now my pieces are nothing more than 
                  body parts that express my thoughts and emotions. <br>
