                  <b>DESCRIPTION </b><br>
                  An installation of drawings done with a high-voltage electric 
                  stylus; additional imagery created on light-sensitive surfaces 
                  exposed to ultraviolet light. In both cases, images on paper 
                  are created by electrical phenomena. <br>
                  <br>
                  The drawings are made using a stylus connected to a high-voltage 
                  generator burns lines of holes through paper or other thin material. 
                  Rapidly-firing sparks arc from the stylus through the material 
                  to a copper-surfaced table. The blueprints, or cyanotypes, are 
                  made on paper coated with ferric ammonium citrate and potassium 
                  ferricyanate - light-sensitive iron salts. This process predates 
                  black-and white photography, but cannot be used with an enlarger 
                  because of the very long exposure time. All images/objects/patterns 
                  are contact-printed on the paper's surface with ultraviolet 
                  light. <b><br>

                  STATEMENT <br>
                  Cyanotype:</b><br>
                  &quot;When I place objects on light-sensitive surfaces in the 
                  sun, I never know how the image will turn out. Or whether it 
                  will. Processing the materialswith a garden hose, I watch the 
                  objects appear as transformed ghosts. When I draw on the images 
                  with household chemicals or power tools, unexpected reactions 
                  occur. Chemistry is the emotion of matter. With these processes, 
                  form filters through the semi-permeable membrane of imagination.&quot;<b> 
                  <br>
                  Burned-hole drawings:<br>
                  </b>&quot;Drawing with a high-voltage electrical stylus carries 
                  with it the risk of occasional electroshock therapy. Not all 
                  bad.&quot; <br>

                  <b>BIO <br>
                  </b>Ellen Ziegler is an artist working in Seattle, WA. Her work 
                  includes installations incorporating water as a subject and 
                  medium, large works on paper using an electric drawing tool 
                  and chemically altered light-sensitive media, and public artworks, 
                  among them fountains and water features. <br>
