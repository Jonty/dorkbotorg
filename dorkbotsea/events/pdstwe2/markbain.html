                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Seven octaves, 84 discrete tones, all at once all the time, 
                  a history of western music as played back in its entirety as 
                  one incessant chord. This drone, this filler of space and monster 
                  of the twelve-tone scale, is unrelenting in its ever pervasiveness. 
                  As a pneumatic sound engine, the Omnisound Generator allows 
                  for remote placement into the machine via air coupled headphones. 
                  Monitoring the insides with stethoscopic precision, hear its 
                  heartbeat, its scream, its infrasonic rumblings and the wind 
                  rushing by. ALL SOUND ENGINES ARE GO! <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>The American artist Mark Bain works on the interface of 
                  acoustics, architecture and actions of conceptual/experiential 
                  integration. For some time Bain has been involved in an ongoing 
                  research into the area of sound and architecture and how sonic 
                  events condition bodies and buildings they occupy. Sculptural 
                  aspects of sound are also investigated in the way resonant materials 
                  can define structures in space. Other installations involve 
                  living systems and investigative devices, which position the 
                  viewer into rarified experiences. In this work, he designs hybrid 
                  apparatuses, which engage both locations and the viewing public. 
                  These are not necessarily products in themselves, but rather 
                  tools developed which lead to certain ends. His research can 
                  be thought as a kind of divining, a loosening, or search for 
                  living entities, defining a presence within that which is normally 
                  thought of as static and dead. <br>
