                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>I am interested in the connection between electronic equipment, 
                  nostalgia and the experience of the sublime. In the piece &quot;Toward 
                  a Possible Bliss&quot; I looked to the box record player as 
                  an invention that allows for sound, and the emotions that are 
                  tied up in music to be transported and shared between people. 
                  Within popular music sentiment is delivered in a direct and 
                  immediate fashion. For this piece I chose to record my version 
                  of &quot;When You're Smiling&quot;, a song that has been recorded 
                  by numerous singers including Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin, 
                  and Nat King Cole. I chose the song because of its commonality; 
                  it is a song that most Americans have heard. Its lyrics have 
                  a saccharine sweet quality to them that I hoped would make the 
                  audience guess whether or not I was being ironic or sincere, 
                  especially in combination with the video of oversaturated flowers. 
                  I want a connection between the viewer as a participant in the 
                  work and myself as the artist. A viewer dropping the needle 
                  onto a record turns on the video. When the record is finished, 
                  the turntable arm returns to its rest and the video turns off 
                  to wait for the next person's involvement to begin again. The 
                  piece recalls experience and emotions, and creates a link between 
                  the viewer and myself. I want the piece to give the viewer the 
                  sense that there are places and events, whether or not they 
                  are constructed, that are beautiful and important. <br>

                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>There is beauty in those moments when we are reminded of 
                  our physicality: when we see the reflection of the sky in a 
                  puddle, or when the first drop of rain reminds us that we are 
                  part of something bigger. In psychoanalysis water stands for 
                  the unconscious mind. The unconscious occupies a large part 
                  of our mind but is rarely expressed in everyday life. The fact 
                  that water, the majority of our physical bodies, was chosen 
                  to represent a part of our life that is not physical is ironic. 
                  I also find it interesting that the concept of the sublime ties 
                  us to the physical world when much of what is considered sublime 
                  is derived from elements of life that remind us of the spiritual. 
                  In &quot;Intravital&quot; I aim to make sense of my own desire 
                  to break down and dissect how aspects of our life such as the 
                  unconscious and the sense of the sublime function. I see an 
                  interconnectedness between our bodies to the natural environment 
                  and the unconscious to the physical world. Ripples of water 
                  mimicked in skin, projected into large Petri dishes; I am intrigued 
                  by the thought of relaxation being contained and studied; yet 
                  separated from the life that could actually hold the emotions 
                  or consciousness. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>There are instances when the environment reminds us of our 
                  lives, such as the point at the beginning of a rainstorm when 
                  you're not sure if you feel the water yet or not, in extreme 
                  weather when our lives are threatened, and also when we encounter 
                  something so breathtaking that for a brief moment our lives 
                  are taken off course. Art has been given the job of capturing 
                  the sublime, providing mementos of things the culture does or 
                  should feel for. Culture moves at an exhausting pace yet it 
                  is difficult to make art about flux, to make objects that ask 
                  the audience to remain still in a culture which constantly threatens 
                  to pass them by. As we leave our bodies to move at the pace 
                  of progress, we pass the physical parts of live which remind 
                  us that we take up space. It is in the moments of the sublime 
                  that life slows down if even for a second. Sculpture provides 
                  me with an opportunity to explore the sublime through direct 
                  experience by allowing a viewer to see the construction, as 
                  well as feel the sensation of the elements, and the phenomena 
                  that is created. Art can still mimic life physically; it can 
                  also mimic the experiences of life, adding interjections to 
                  remind us of the pace at which we live and how one perceives 
                  beauty and the sublime.</p>
                <p>I aim to create work that is beautiful; I want the viewer to 
                  be at first attracted to the form and display and after the 
                  information provided in the materials sets in, I want the viewer 
                  to be somewhat repulsed by the futility of the gesture of mimicking 
                  the experiences of the natural world. I desire to artistically 
                  explore a sense of constructedness and impermanence, which reminded 
                  me of our own impermanence despite the best efforts of science 
                  and medicine. While technology explains away things that were 
                  once mysteries, phenomena, or even miracles, the sight of such 
                  occurrences still inspire awe. The sublime comes from a need 
                  to be awed, a need to break routine, a need to feel there is 
                  still wonder in the world around us. As the natural environment 
                  shrinks, the sublime recedes into such miniscule events as the 
                  concentric rings formed from a drop of water, of the reflection 
                  of the sky in a puddle alongside the walkway.<br>
