                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>If &quot;Art is the lie that makes us realize the truth&quot;, 
                  then art contains far too much lying; far too much of the shallow 
                  facade of technical expertise, or with luck, too much of shallow 
                  surface esthetics. No matter the acclaim directed at certain 
                  works, usually we detect nothing beneath their surface besides 
                  our own psychological projections. The Quality within a piece 
                  depends almost entirely on the perceiver, and most art is one-dimensional 
                  in this way. But is it even POSSIBLE to create Quality which 
                  is separate from the Quality projected by a human audience? 
                  Let's find out. My goal is to attack the universal trend of 
                  art based on shallow facades and viewer-provided interpretation.

                  The &quot;Pond Machine&quot; series attempts to expose the deep 
                  and multi-level esthetics concealed behind the mundane face 
                  of the material world. The series is focused upon a single element 
                  in nature: the nature of water. Then it explores various ideas 
                  phenomena by presenting distorted but active embodiments of 
                  the hidden physics and mathematics of fluids in order to make 
                  these ideas and phenomena directly visible, or better yet, directly 
                  grasped. Rather than the well-explored &quot;art as Rorschach-blot&quot;, 
                  call it &quot;art as chemistry-set&quot;. With luck, something 
                  inside you may explode or catch fire.<br>
