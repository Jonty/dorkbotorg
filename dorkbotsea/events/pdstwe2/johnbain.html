                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>This installation features nine video cameras in an array 
                  in front of a video monitor. The audience is invited to face 
                  the video screen, as if in front of a mirror, while nine cameras 
                  are presenting their image from nine different viewpoints, all 
                  within a fraction of a second. Each camera senses motion within 
                  their respective frame and this determines which image is presented 
                  onto the screen. This essentially is a time and space based 
                  mirror where one can view multiple angles of oneself, temporally 
                  superimposed through split second &quot;flickers&quot;. How 
                  one moves within the viewed space determines how the images 
                  are perceived. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>American artist John Bain re-purposes digital technology 
                  in ways that are unintended by the original manufactures. He 
                  re-constructs and modifies internal circuits to build autonomous 
                  self-generating organisms perceived as sound. He has developed 
                  techniques for interbreeding the resulting data flows from these 
                  devices so that multiple autonomous units become one large self-sensing 
                  organism. He presents this work in his project, Mutant Data 
                  Orchestra. His interactive installation work deals with how 
                  people utilize pre-existing architectural conditions. How people 
                  move through a space drives how the piece is composed and perceived 
                  in real time as sound and image. Everyday architectural use 
                  is translated into a new representation, mapping the decisions 
                  every occupant has to make within space. <br>
