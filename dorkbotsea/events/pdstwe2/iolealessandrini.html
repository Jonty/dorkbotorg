                  DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br>
                  </b>An intangible plane of light stretching 10 feet high and 
                  20 feet wide between walls, floor and ceiling sets the threshold 
                  between two rooms at the CoCA gallery. It is a luminous gate 
                  that appears to be opening and closing around the people as 
                  they pass through it and intersect it. A freestanding wall symmetrically 
                  located between the threshold and one inch behind the plane 
                  displays a picture of a person moving slowly across the plane.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Emerging from experiments with lasers, optics and digital 
                  photography, Threshold explores themes of moving beyond luminous 
                  boundaries, perhaps feeling like light, radiant and intangible, 
                  like walking through walls via the imagination and flying in 
                  dreams&quot;. [excerpt from Untitled at Jack Straw Productions,

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>&quot;Through manipulation of light, digital media and physical 
                  space, I design and build ephemeral, controlled environments 
                  that people enter rather than observe from a distance. Light 
                  is energy: waves and particles of infinitesimal dimensions that 
                  are made visible by boundaries. Architecture is movement: a 
                  powerful and meaningful symbol that redefines space and invents 
                  new functions. Physical space in its states of transformation 
                  solicits emotional feelings and brings back memories. Light, 
                  being a remote projection from a time of which we have no memory, 
                  challenges these feelings and moves our emotions and ideas forward.&quot;
