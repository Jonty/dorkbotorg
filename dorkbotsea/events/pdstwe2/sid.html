                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Our video installation uses the assembly line as a metaphor 
                  for mass production. Through video, SID continues to reveal 
                  and manipulate the mechanisms within plush toys. These uncovered 
                  toy bots personify a society surrounded by mass consumption 
                  where products are shipped out of factories in record quantity. 
                  These stuffed animals have been quickly discarded as the latest 
                  fad eclipses the last and fuels new frenzied buying. By disassembling 
                  and videotaping the underlying robotics we evaluate the toy 
                  and the process of consumerism. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT: Unmaking It&#133;.The story of S.I.D. INC. <br>
                  </b>SID Inc. is the collaboration of two artists involved in 
                  imaginative play. By redefining familiar objects, we introduce 
                  a new reality to the forgotten toy. We take discarded thrift 
                  store stuffed mechanical rejects and invent ways to display 
                  our play. <br>
                  <br>
                  Our plush toys and their constructions are based on recurrent 
                  action sustained through consumer whimsy. All of the mechanisms 
                  we choose are activated by motion, sound, or touch that stress 
                  the importance of education through entertainment. <br>
                  <br>
                  We propose that the marketing, purchase, and speedy donation 
                  of these toys allude to a consumptive market characterized by 
                  buying escapism and frenzy. Toys have a very short shelf life 
                  that leads to an even shorter home life. We believe that consumer 
                  involvement in this repetition is a blazing sign of its success. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In a future presentation, we plan to construct our discarded 
                  &quot;toy-bots&quot; out of sterling silver. This contrast between 
                  the discarded forgotten object and the cherished precious one 
                  underscores our societal contradictions. There is a fleeting 
                  value placed on low-priced multiple objects while the cleverly 
                  crafted art object becomes a deified possession. What's the 
                  difference between a beautifully designed plastic toy and its 
                  sterling imitation? <br>
