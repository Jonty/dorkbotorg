                  <b>MATERIALS:</b> Assorted found objects, discarded PC parts

                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>The Zundelphone is an interactive musical device that uses 
                  simple iconography to encourage viewer interaction in creating 
                  a unique piece of &quot;music&quot;. The Zundelphone consists 
                  of a main console with several simple button controls, some 
                  lighted icon-styled indicators and a microphone. By lighting 
                  different icons, the piece will attempt to solicit specific 
                  viewer actions such as speaking into the microphone in a particular 
                  manner, thus selecting a tempo or style of music. The Zundelphone 
                  will then perform the unique piece. The music is played through 
                  separate speakers and sound transducers that use pieces salvaged 
                  items for tonal shaping. While the music is played, a unique 
                  light display is created using iconic indicators on the icon 
                  display which will animate the unique experience. The actual 
                  music created by the Zundelphone includes familiar elements 
                  of modern western music while incorporating non-traditional 
                  tonal and temporal qualities created by the viewers own voices 
                  or noises. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>The daughter of an electrical engineer, Michele grew up 
                  surrounded by electronics and technology. Encouraged to experiment 
                  and discover, Michele spent much of her teen years learning 
                  the basics of electronic theory. After studying music for several 
                  years in college, Michele's natural attraction to computers 
                  prompted her to change her focus and study mathematics and computer 
                  science. Michele continues to experiment and explore applications 
                  of electronics in unusual ways, leveraging her professional 
                  background in software engineering and computer systems development 
                  to aid her artistic visions. Her current focus is development 
                  of unusual electronic works that use time as the key element 
                  for the viewer experience. <br>
