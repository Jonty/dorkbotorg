                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>CoAdNe and CoDeAn are soft sound sculptures encased in fabric 
                  patchwork. They each include a programmable chip, which enables 
                  them to emit grunts and croaks of noisy electronic sounds at 
                  random intervals through an embedded speaker. These sculptures' 
                  voices are in the language of ancient creatures from the depths. 
                  The patchwork is a hand-sewn collage of fabric transferred video 
                  stills from our recordings made using homemade, modified, and 
                  commercial instruments. These sculptures are the materialization 
                  of media; they are companions for the technological age. <br>
                  <br>
                  By mixing hard and soft materials, encasing electronic components 
                  in uncommon materials such as fabric, these sculptures develop 
                  a feeling of familiarity and warmth. At the same time, they 
                  suggest an absence of an animal's material body as if it has 
                  recently disappeared in a burst of static. The sculptural celebration 
                  of homemade electronics and handmade aesthetic exemplify our 
                  intimate and tangible relationship with technology. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>LoVid is a project by Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus. Hinkis 
                  graduated from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris in 2000 and 
                  has been living and working in New York City since. Prior to 
                  LoVid Tali's single channel and video performances were presented 
                  in festivals and screenings worldwide. Lapidus studied science 
                  and electronic music at Harvard. He has been involved in producing 
                  and distributing experimental music for years. Kyle has performed, 
                  recorded, and toured in many noise and performance based bands. 
                  Kyle and Tali began collaborating as LoVid in 2001. Since then, 
                  LoVid has toured the US and Europe extensively, performing and 
                  exhibiting at the Big Apple Fest, Eyebeam, Happy Lion LA, SOUTHFIRST, 
                  Harvestworks, WAX, NY Underground Film Festival, Deitch Projects, 
                  Philadelphia Fringe Festival, and Institute of Contemporary 
                  Art, London among many others. LoVid scramble electrical current 
                  into hyperkinetic audiovisual abstraction, which takes the familiar 
                  and reveals its astral nature. Using homemade electronic devices 
                  and DIY sculptural instruments, LoVid overwhelms the senses 
                  with new media in both their sculptures and live performances.
