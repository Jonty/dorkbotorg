                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Plutarch is a bit of a mystery to me. I named it for a first 
                  century Greek historian who wrote a huge tome, &quot;Lives of 
                  Illustrious Men&quot;, about famous Greeks and then compared 
                  them to famous Romans. The artwork of this name also has lived 
                  several lives, none of which were remotely related to the finished 
                  product. One part first lived as a calibration oscillator for 
                  a shortwave radio. The second part was the demodulator and audio 
                  amplifier for a VLF (very low frequency) converter. The third 
                  part lived for a while as a VFO (variable frequency oscillator) 
                  in an experiment. The way for me to compare all these bits and 
                  pieces was to string them all together, mix the outputs, stand 
                  back and see what would happen. <br>
                  <br>
                  I can tell you what Plutarch is not. It is not a Theremin, nor 
                  a metal locator, nor a proximity detector although it marries 
                  together some of the features of all of these instruments. The 
                  best description I can come up with is &quot;Touch me and I'll 
                  tell&quot;, because that is the way Plutarch behaves. If you 
                  touch his exposed member, he will let you and everyone around 
                  know his space has been invaded. Plutarch warbles and wails 
                  when touched and he loves the attention. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT: A PACKRAT'S PLAN FOR ART <br>
                  </b>1) Be a collector. I started very young and had trouble 
                  with the Borough of Roselle Park, N.J. The place was an eclectic 
                  mix of houses, farms, factories, railroad yards, a county dump 
                  and a park. The dump was a few blocks from our house and was 
                  a virtual mine of good stuff for a kid. The Borough set up a 
                  trash collection service for the homeowners and to that end 
                  hired an Italian farmer with a horse-drawn manure wagon to collect 
                  the stuff. When the wagon was filled, he would haul the contents 
                  to the dump. One day came a loud knock on our back door and 
                  Mr. Adase, the Italian farmer, holds up a large metal pipe with 
                  flexible metal hose attached and says to my mother, &quot;Lady, 
                  three times I haula away this hunka junk from your house and 
                  I do it again but this is last time&quot;. Another time Mom 
                  was walking the dog on the road past the dump and someone up 
                  on the railroad track hollers &quot;Hey kid, picking any chunk?' 
                  Yep, it was me again. <br>
                  <br>
                  2) See the hidden art in found objects. Once in Aspen, I saw 
                  a knight welded up from old auto parts and that got me going. 
                  I first studied blacksmithing and bought a coal-fired forge 
                  to heat and bend metal. Next I learned gas and arc welding at 
                  a vocational school in Boulder and began to inhabit junkyards 
                  and auto wrecking yards to look for neat stuff. When I retired 
                  and moved to Spokane I found the time to collect things and 
                  begin putting art projects together. One of my favorites was 
                  a pterodactyl made of steel plate, rebar, and part of a sewer 
                  auger. Someone else must have liked it too because one night 
                  persons unknown climbed up to the porch eaves and cut it down 
                  with bolt cutters. Pictures of it were shown on local TV but 
                  it never was found. <br>
                  <br>
                  3) Be open and try new art forms. When Laura presented me with 
                  two coils she wove on a loom and wondered what could be done 
                  with them, I wondered too. After several measurements on a Q 
                  meter and an impedance bridge, I had the answer. They could 
                  be used in the tuned circuits of a Theremin. People like me, 
                  who build electronic things from scratch, must be serious collectors 
                  of components found at flea markets, garage sales, auctions, 
                  estate sales, and going out of business sales. Just about all 
                  the parts needed for Laura's Theremin came out of my junk box. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  4) Be a collaborator. It is fun and rewarding to work with someone 
                  on an art project because they bring different values and ideas 
                  into the mix. One person does not have all the answers and really 
                  needs another for input and help to bring things together. Artists 
                  tend to be loners but some projects are so diverse and rely 
                  on so many different skills and talents that collaboration may 
                  be the only way to successful completion. <br>
                  <br>
                  5) Think young. Old as I am, I try to understand the view point 
                  of artists who are so much younger than I. They have ideas that 
                  would never occur to me and at first I may unimpressed but then, 
                  when I look more closely, I begin to get an inkling of what 
                  they want to do and become enthusiastic and really excited about 
                  their skill and the beauty of their art. </p>
