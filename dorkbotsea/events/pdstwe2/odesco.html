                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>The concept behind Nano-City &quot;is that technological 
                  advance and ecological responsibility are not necessarily a 
                  contradiction in terms. (Please read the STORYLINE below). This 
                  project lives in the world as &quot;science-fact&quot; and not 
                  &quot;science-fiction&quot; and conceptually demonstrates that 
                  although many of our ecological equilibrium disparities are 
                  a result of our misuse and misunderstanding of technological 
                  advance, many of them can be brought back into balance with 
                  appropriate technological focus. Our aim is to make the point 
                  that technological development from within the fields of design 
                  and architecture can be focused to transcend ecological equilibrium; 
                  to have positive embodied energy assessments, material reductions 
                  and even change living pattern trends. <br>

                  <b> STORYLINE: NANO-CITY* <br>
                  </b>The head of the city resembles a massive mechanical cathedral 
                  but would fool anyone who examined it for too long. For all 
                  of its apparent symmetrically flaunting oppressiveness, it is 
                  nonexistent. Indeed at any instant it does exist but it is ever 
                  changing, morphing, melding, destroying and creating. Itself. 
                  For the city itself is in fact one and the same with the landscape 
                  that it ploughs through. The city moves across the planet without 
                  regard for the forests, the seas, the deserts and the glaciers. 
                  For any and all landscapes is fuel for its growth. The city 
                  is a momentary composition of tiny machines, so tiny that they 
                  operate at the atomic and molecular level. The machines are 
                  just as invisible as the atoms they are composed of. Essentially 
                  the entire city is composed of nano-sized robots. There are 
                  gatherers, sorters, transporters, assemblers and dis-assemblers. 
                  The assemblers work endlessly immersed in a bath of parts or 
                  molecules that have been gathered from the landscape, sorted 
                  and transported, along a nano-conveyor belt system to the point 
                  where they can be reassembled and bonded to the new molecular 
                  structure of a part of the city. A tree in the forest is disassembled 
                  to the molecular level and transported to the other end of the 
                  city and reassembled into the city. On and on it goes, tearing 
                  up everything in its path and creating paths where there are 
                  none for the sake of creating the city. The city rolls out from 
                  the back of the head like a perfectly geometric beaver's tail: 
                  houses and parks and playgrounds and streetlights and furniture 
                  and food and even toys. The people of the city find homes but 
                  they never grow terribly attached to them because everyone understands 
                  the temporal frailty of the city. There is no money and no one 
                  seems to care what others have because the city is constantly 
                  churning out new designs for the urban fabric. Everyone simply 
                  migrates towards the head of the city because that is where 
                  the newest of everything is to be found. Of course they also 
                  must constantly move towards the head because the rear of the 
                  city is always disintegrating literally from beneath the citizens' 
                  feet. It is not so drastic as that, and a house may take upwards 
                  of three years to completely disintegrate but it does indeed 
                  keep the people moving. On the macro scale then, as a result 
                  of the nano-scale, the city operates as a conveyor as well. 
                  The disintegrating city is reconstructed into the forest, or 
                  sea, or desert or glaciers. Where once was a mountain a new 
                  one was built in its place. <br>
                  <br>
                  Everything stays in balance; natural resources can replenish 
                  themselves as fuel for the next time the city rolls by and the 
                  citizens never tire of the scenery. <br>

                  Production Conveyer Belt City, by the Italian Group &quot;Superstudio&quot; 
                  written in 1961. We have substituted optimism for pessimism.
