                  <b> BIO/STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Reiquam is a Seattle artist whose work ranges from prints 
                  and drawings to sculptural furniture, mechanical sculptures 
                  and public art projects. He earned his B.F.A. in sculpture from 
                  the University of Washington in 1982 and his M.F.A. in sculpture 
                  from Yale University in 1984. He was employed as the Head Technician 
                  and Head of the Sculpture Department at Pratt Fine Arts Center 
                  for over ten years. Reiquam served two three-year terms as a 
                  commissioner on the King County Public Art Commission and has 
                  twice taught quarter-long courses as a Visiting Lecturer in 
                  the Sculpture Department at the University of Washington School 
                  of Art. In 2003, Reiquam joined a group of Seattle area artists 
                  in a new public art mentorship program at the City of Seattle's 
                  Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs (formerly Seattle Arts Commission) 
                  to assist emerging artists in the development of their first 
                  public art projects. He recently completed an eighty-foot long 
                  fence with graphic images at the King County International Airport 
                  (Boeing Field) and a series of granite benches for a subway 
                  station in Los Angeles, California. In addition to the production 
                  of his own artwork, Reiquam's business, New Art Projects Company 
                  specializes in the fabrication and installation of the work 
                  of a variety of other artists, architects and designers. <br>
