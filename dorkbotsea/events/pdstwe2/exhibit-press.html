                  emerging and established local and national artists from Seattle 
                  to Baton Rouge, Boston and New York City, each exhibit uses 
                  electricity as a major component of its creation and/or its 
                  display. The exhibition will run through March 3rd, 2005. </p>
                <p>Exhibiting artists reflect the diversity and inclusiveness 
                  of the global dorkbot community, encompassing established artists 
                  broadening their creative horizons, emerging artists working

                  exploring the artistic possibilities of their field of expertise. 
                  Exhibitors' ages range from high school junior to retired University 
                  professor, and they express themselves in media and disciplines

                  sculpture, sound and video installations, blown glass, living 
                  grass, patchwork, weaving, lasers and LEDs. A <b>People's Choice 
                  Award</b> of one thousand dollars will be given to the artist 
                  whose work receives the most votes during the course of the 
                  exhibition.</p>

                  under a revolutionary Creative Commons licensing agreement, 
                  which enables artists to permit unlimited non-commercial sampling

                  from Seattle and Canada and one-night-only light-themed installations 
                  by local artists will create a dynamic environment that celebrates 
                  technology's role in making art - and in helping us have a jolly
