                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>This piece consists of a terrarium containing solar powered 
                  BEAMs robots of varying shapes, sizes, and constructions. The 
                  solar power is provided by two halogen light bulbs powered with 
                  electricity from two standard electrical outlets and activated 
                  by motion detectors. Through the use of motion detectors the 
                  piece will be interactive and invite audience participation: 
                  while the terrarium is staged to look normal and the viewer 
                  expects a pet lizard or other reptile, as they approach they 
                  are instead confronted with BEAMs robots that gradually come 
                  to life. BEAM is an acronym for Biological Artistic Electrical 
                  Mechanical robots, electrical non-computerized machines that 
                  operate in a mathematically chaotic manner. Unique in their 
                  movements and interactions with the others in the space, the 
                  robots will form their own microcosm. While they each have solar 
                  cells and a circuit board that informs their individual goals 
                  and methods of movement, they form a collective ecosystem. This 
                  glass contained ecosystem is illustrative of the larger world: 
                  though individuals are independent, people are still affected 
                  by the action, in this case the movement, of others. The piece's 
                  meaning is made clear in its visual elements. Beyond the ecosystem 
                  that the individual robots create as a collective, the use of 
                  the terrarium is quintessential. Spiders, bugs, lizards and 
                  other reptiles are the typical inhabitants of this kind of enclosed 
                  ecosystem. As spectators approach, they see what appears to 
                  be &quot;real&quot;, but as the lights are triggered by the 
                  motion sensor, they are forced to look closer at something often 
                  considered mundane. This piece can be seen as an attempt to 
                  challenge the definition of &quot;real&quot; by placing robots, 
                  inanimate without electricity, in an environment inhabited by 
                  living creatures. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Christopher O'Dowd is currently a junior at the Center School 
                  in Seattle, Washington. He had an early fascination with electricity 
                  after experiencing first hand the shocking effects of electrical 
                  sockets on the human body as he attempted to examine the source 
                  of their power. Robots had a specific draw because of their 
                  complexity and the opportunities they provided for problem solving 
                  and for the development of a deep appreciation of patience. 
                  As he mastered the technical understanding and skill to create 
                  functional machines, he realized that the same complexity that 
                  he observed in the circuitry of Spyder2 (a 9 motor walking robot) 
                  could be applied in an artistic sense to BEAMs robots. His robot 
                  building took on new meaning as he realized that his attempts 
                  to draw attention to out of the ordinary objects could serve 
                  as a kind of activism. By juxtaposing robots with banal environments 
                  and locations, he seeks to draw attention to the processes that 
                  individuals use to understand the underlying order in the world 
                  around them. <br>
