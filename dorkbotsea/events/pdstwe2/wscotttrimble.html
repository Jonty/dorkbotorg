                  <b>DESCRIPTION </b><br>
                  Moving Pictures is a kinetic sculpture that shows the very, 
                  very slow movement of images superimposed upon one another. 
                  The images are on glass plates. Each glass plate has a different 
                  image. This culmination of images completes a single image, 
                  except that since the images on the plates are in a very slow, 
                  constant movement, the composition is always changing. The moving 
                  picture is aided by a light source, illuminating the changing 
                  images. The slow movement is generated by a custom made gearbox 
                  that generates a incredibly slow rate of speed. The gearbox 
                  drives articulating arms that move the image-imposed glass plates 
                  back and forth. The viewfinder will is an ornate baroque-styled 
                  gilded picture frame that the viewer peers through to see the 
                  moving picture, pushing a button to make the sculpture engage 
                  for a predetermined amount of time. <b><br>

                  STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>I have always had a fascination for the contrast between 
                  industry, nature, figure, and machine. Much of my work has dealt 
                  with the notion of the influence of technology over our lives, 
                  posing the question whether or not technology has given us more 
                  freedom. I am continually interested in interactive art and 
                  work that is created for the public context. <br>
