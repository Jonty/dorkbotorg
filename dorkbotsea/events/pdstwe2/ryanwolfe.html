                  <b>DESCRIPTION </b><br>
                  This piece explores the idea that a memorable time, place or 
                  experience can be condensed in a singular, physical object that 
                  embodies the essential qualities of that experience. It is one 
                  in a series of sketches that encapsulate the experience of watching 
                  the rise and fall of a summer breeze across a field in a single 
                  blade of grass (or a series of blades of grass). <br>
                  <br>
                  This particular sketch is comprised of eight blades of grass. 
                  Each blade is a complete computational system with the ability 
                  to sense and respond to its environment. A simple networking 
                  protocol is used to propagate wind data down the network, blade 
                  by blade. The technology has been designed to be modular. Future 
                  sketches in the series can be scaled up in size merely by adding 
                  blade &quot;nodes&quot;. Other variations between sketches include 
                  changes in the software algorithms that control movement and 
                  the generation of wind. The technology developed for this piece 
                  is ultimately scalable to a grid network, allowing for an entire 
                  gallery space to be transformed into a dynamic kinetic experience.

                  <br>
                  While it was much more challenging to realize this piece as 
                  a collection of decentralized computers rather than as a monolithic 
                  computer controlling a network of addressable sensors and actuators, 
                  the individual response each node has to its surroundings is 
                  an important conceptual element of the piece. Just as in a real 
                  field, each blade responds to the wind in a slightly different 
                  way. Each blade is both physically distinct and simultaneously 
                  part of a larger aggregate phenomenon. The emergent behavior 
                  that comes from the interrelation of independent nodal behavior 
                  interpreted in a group context is fundamental to the overall 
                  aesthetic effect.<b> <br>

                  STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>In my work I isolate and extract the defining elements of 
                  a physical place or moment in time, and then use those elements 
                  as a palette for designing objects that embody the essential 
                  quality or qualities of the actual experience. <br>
                  <br>
                  While we all experience the world with analog sensory and cognitive 
                  systems, there is a digital-like granularity to how we analyze 
                  and store experiences. We don't remember every single point 
                  in time as a discreet instant -- rather our memories are aggregations 
                  of a number of instances that we have grouped based on some 
                  perceived similarity. Our memories are often are defined by 
                  a very singular element: the quality of light on a cold fall 
                  day; the hive-like dance of people and machines at a crowded 
                  downtown intersection; the visible rise and fall of a summer 
                  breeze as experienced by a field of grass. My interest is in 
                  isolating the definitive qualities of remembered experiences 
                  and reinterpreting them within the confines of a constructed 
                  object; essentially condensing the whole of a lived moment in 
                  time in a refined, physical reinterpretation. <br>
