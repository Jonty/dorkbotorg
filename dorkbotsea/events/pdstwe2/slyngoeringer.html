                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>The installation tone, stop. The intersection of two sound 
                  lines. E presented in People Doing Strange Things With Electricity 
                  II is a multi-channel location specific audio installation, 
                  designed with both the space and acoustic considerations of 
                  CoCA taken into account. Seating is not provided in the installation 
                  to encourage visitors to move around so they can experience 
                  how the audio changes based on their location within the space.

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>My primary artistic focus is on how sound affects and interacts 
                  with space. With tone, stop. The intersection of two sound lines, 
                  E. I deliberately incorporated sound from two sources. The primary 
                  sound source is a soundscape/sculpture that is projected from 
                  the five speakers surrounding visitors. The second source is 
                  the incidental noise present in the rest of the gallery. The 
                  incidental noise meshes with my goal to incorporate a chance 
                  aspect within the work, and more importantly, these secondary 
                  sounds maintain a connection with the community of art present 
                  in the gallery. This space is still part of the larger whole 
                  and cannot be separated from that context, even while visitors 
                  are encouraged to walk inside of and be affected by the space.<br>
