                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>&quot;bodhi&quot; is a lightbox of proprietary design by 
                  the artist, and which is hung on the wall via a proprietary 
                  system that enables it to slide along two anchors. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>The lightboxes originally started as a vehicle for my poetry, 
                  but eventually I couldn't resist playing around with the addition 
                  of my photographic imagery as well. The fact that the poetry 
                  glows when the boxes are turned on was a complete accident, 
                  a perfect manifestation of the mystery of the creative process 
                  where my life pulls itself into balance independent of linear 
                  thought processes... <br>
                  <br>
                  The medium itself took almost a full year to gestate from the 
                  time I decided to go ahead with the idea to the time I hung 
                  my first hard-won box. At first I looked into using commercial 
                  grade boxes as a quick solution, but in the end I wanted something 
                  that could create more visual depth, which is what led me to 
                  create my own proprietary medium. <br>
