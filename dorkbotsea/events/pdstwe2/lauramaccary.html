                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>This interactive piece consists of a hand woven panel of 
                  switches attached to a circuit board with LEDs which correspond 
                  one-to-one with the switches in the panel. The switches are 
                  made of pairs of fine wires, which are woven into the fabric 
                  so that they are in close proximity but do not touch. The viewer's 
                  finger provides a conductive surface across which the current 
                  can pass to connect the two sides of each circuit. Touching 
                  a switch causes the corresponding LED to light. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>I am a weaver studying electronics. My father, Lawrence 
                  MacCary, is a sculptor and a longtime electronics experimenter. 
                  I grew up playing with electronic toys he made and sometimes 
                  I got to help wind coils or salvage parts. His &quot;infernal 
                  machines&quot; came out of the workshop for hair-raising demonstrations 
                  at parties. All of this gave me a sense of delight about electronics. 
                  When I decided to make a series of works which combine weaving 
                  and electronics, I was excited that he was interested in collaborating 
                  on circuit design.</p>
                <p>Weaving is a ubiquitous but little-noticed technology, viewed 
                  as unremarkable even though it is essential to human survival. 
                  Electronics is another technology that is becoming so omnipresent 
                  and so integrated with our lives that we will soon cease to 
                  notice it. However, electronics is sure to cross the boundary 
                  of our skin, and enter our bodies. Its fields already do.</p>
                <p>It is this intimate interface between people and technology 
                  that I'm examining in this series of works. Each piece in the 
                  series consists of an electronic component woven of conductive 
                  or resistive materials, cast-off by industry, and a circuit 
                  designed around the weaving. By interacting with the weaving 
                  the viewer physically enters the circuit, and the circuit passes 
                  through the viewer, blurring the boundary between them.</p>
                <p>The title of the series, Dialectric, is taken from the words 
                  dialectic, meaning the juxtaposition or interaction of two conflicting 
                  ideas or forces, and dielectric, an insulating substance or 
                  one in which an electric field can be maintained with a minimum 
                  loss of power. I see these as metaphors for the participants 
                  in an interaction, and the space between them. <br>

                  <b>TITLE:</b> Huggable HAL <br>
                  <b>MATERIALS:</b> Electronics, glass, fabric, foam <br>
                  <b>DIMENSIONS:</b> 9 1/2&quot; x 9 1/2&quot; x 9 1/2&quot; <br>

                  <br>
                  <b> DESCRIPTION AND STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>This HAL references the HAL 9000 computer from the movie 
                  2001. Each HAL is a cube or block about ten inches on a side, 
                  with a glowering red eye that lights up when you hug it, but 
                  the eye fades unless you keep hugging. Ironically, hugging them 
                  forever would eventually run their batteries down, sort of a 
                  damned if you do, damned if you don't kind of thing.</p>
                <p>I'm thinking about our relationship with technology, how intimate 
                  it is, how we anthropomorphize, and as the movie points out, 
                  how technology is a double-edged sword. For me there is some 
                  conflicted pathos in hugging or consoling this murderous/helpless 
                  device. Who is manipulating whom? <br>
