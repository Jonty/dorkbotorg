                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>&quot;Here's Looking at You&quot; is a photo booth that, 
                  at first glance, looks like any other. The viewer enters the 
                  booth, closes the privacy curtain, inserts money, and poses 
                  for the timed strobes. When the strip is developed, however, 
                  the images do not appear as expected. Instead of the standard 
                  frontal shots, they show the subject as seen from a hidden security 
                  camera in the upper left hand corner of the booth. <br>
                  <br>
                  With this photo booth, Line Up examines the increasingly blurred 
                  boundary between public and private life after 9/11 and the 
                  ownership of one's image in the information age. With heightened 
                  security concerns, our images appear almost constantly on surveillance 
                  footage everywhere. The keepsake images produced by Line Up's 
                  photo booth are a reclamation of one's skewed, captured image. 
                  As a fully functional object, the booth is initially seen as 
                  an overt art object. Its camouflage of familiarity increases 
                  the effect of the resulting image. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT<br>
                  </b>Line Up is a collaborative of independent artists that come 
                  together to explore the contemporary challenges of a given public 
                  space. The members of the group share a fascination with the 
                  design and function of public spaces in America, and the unsettling 
                  aspects such sites. Their subject matter has included mall food 
                  courts, hotel event rooms, high school gymnasiums, and suburban 
                  developments. &quot;Here's Looking at You&quot; was originally 
                  installed in Eero Saarinen's Terminal 5 at JFK International 
                  Airport. <br>
