                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Bohr developed the initial quantum atom theory and Einstein 
                  found the use of probability in quantum theory unacceptable. 
                  The dice are arranged in a physically impossible form, a Penrose 
                  tribar, which seems to both represent the counter intuitive 
                  nature of quantum theory as well as the chance element. The 
                  dice also refer to Einstein's famous quote about God and dice. 
                  The quantum atom now assumes an electron shell that is described 
                  in terms of probabilities and Hawking's quote refers to quantum 
                  theory applied to black holes. <br>

                  <b> BIO/STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>I have always found M.C. Escher's prints fascinating and 
                  as a personal challenge, decided to attempt a series of photographs 
                  based on the ideas in his prints. Quantum Atom uses the same 
                  illusion as Escher's Waterfall in a comment on the Bohr-Einstein 
                  controversy. <br>
                  <br>
                  Dr. Martin started his academic career with a fine sense of 
                  indecision. His initial majors were both electrical and mechanical 
                  engineering. He then switched to physics and then psychology. 
                  By the time he was forced to graduate he happened to be in mathematics. 
                  A chance remark caused him to start graduate work in statistics 
                  although he had never had a statistics course. His initial academic 
                  appointments were in Biomathematics and Engineering Research 
                  at North Carolina State. He then moved to the University of 
                  Washington in Biostatistics with an Adjoint appointment in Psychiatry 
                  and Behavioral Sciences. He has approximately 100 scientific 
                  publications and hands on experimental experience. He retired 
                  from UW about 5 years ago. <br>
                  <br>
                  In the distant past he was a serious medium format and an early 
                  underwater photographer. After retirement from UW he returned 
                  to photography and tried digital photography. After three months 
                  of digital work he gave away his darkroom equipment. He is currently 
                  running a small photography business and exploring some of the 
                  possibilities of computer manipulation of images. <br>
