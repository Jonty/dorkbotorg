                  </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Since about 1997 I have been creating work using my scanner 
                  as a lens to capture images. I have come to appreciate the artifacts 
                  that I get by using this process. Scanning 3 dimensional objects 
                  creates unexpected anomalies that can then be used to carve 
                  and embellish the surface of the image. While I do use Photoshop 
                  to shape the images I want, it is by no means the driving force 
                  for these images, only a vehicle to facilitate my ideas. <br>
                  <br>
                  The start of this current series actually came about after creating 
                  vector images and observing that they would never come close 
                  to the feel that I was after. One evening I left my studio and 
                  went to a local park in West Seattle - there, I sat on the beach 
                  and after sunset returned with some interesting pieces of driftwood. 
                  While scanning them I realized that the organic input was what 
                  I had needed to get beyond the digital feel of my subjects. 
                  I have progressed to the point of working with toys from my 
                  childhood, artifacts from my life, the familiar and intimate 
                  souls of shoes and even standing on my scanner to get the source 
                  material I then transform. <br>
                  <br>
                  My intention is not to collage a composition but to capture 
                  an object and extract its' soul. <br>
