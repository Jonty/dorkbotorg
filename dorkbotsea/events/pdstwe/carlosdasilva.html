                  <b>MATERIALS:</b> Sound Installation: Original electronic composition

                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>This piece is a musical composition, restrained on melody 
                  that has been composed solely with computer and electronic based 
                  instruments alongside sounds recorded in the jungles of Thailand. 
                  All sounds were generated via modular synthesis including all 
                  EEG waves. All sounds planned and randomly generated were arranged 
                  and composed into a repeating but linear musical composition. 
                  Within this piece there are various sonically induced tones 
                  aimed to trigger various states of brainwave activity such as 
                  increased mental awareness, relaxation, excitement, etc. This 
                  piece is set up in conjunction with Udderthump 2000, with two 
                  channels specially created for Udderthump's transducers, allowing 
                  people to feel, as well as hear, the composition. <br>
