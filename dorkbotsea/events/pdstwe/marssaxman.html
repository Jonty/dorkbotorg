                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Starfish 2 is the latest iteration of an eight year computer 
                  graphics project. The software is neither creative nor intelligent, 
                  and I have made no attempt to make Starfish draw or paint like 
                  a human being would. Instead, the system is based on structures 
                  familiar to a computer, carefully balanced to produce results 
                  that will please a human viewer. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Natural processes create patterns human beings find beautiful: 
                  the curving parallels of an eroded sandstone canyon wall, the 
                  paired spirals in a sunflower's seeds, the rippled sand-drifts 
                  on a shallow streambed. In Starfish I have taken mechanisms 
                  familiar to nature - waves, tesselation, transparency, and others 
                  - and combined them with formulas natural to the computer to 
                  create an engine for artificial patternmaking. The images are 
                  rhythmic and sometimes beautiful; clearly artificial, but they 
                  can also resemble natural textures such as wood, stone, and 
                  water. I am fascinated by self-driven software systems and by 
                  the complex behaviours that arise from interactions of simple 
                  phenomena. I wrote all of the pieces Starfish uses to assemble 
                  its patterns, but its combinations can still surprise me. <br>

                  <b>BIO </b><br>
                  Mars Saxman is a computer programmer with a lifelong interest 
                  in the graphic arts, particularly photography and illustration. 
                  His career has ranged from screen savers and streaming video 
                  to filesystems and programming tools; his current job involves 
                  a cross-platform Basic compiler. With more interests than time 
                  to pursue them, Mars frequently finds himself developing software 
                  tools to automate his creative work. <br>
