                  Ch'ien / The Creative<br>
                  The creative works sublime success,<br>
                  Furthering through perseverance. <br>
                  <br>
                  In 1987, I was at work on studio images to accompany a bi-annual 
                  report. I ran out of 4x5 Polaroid film, which I used to test 
                  for lighting and composition. Requiring Polaroid, I grabbed 
                  some unusual emulsion from the shelf, Type 53 (film speed 800). 
                  As I continued, I noticed that the image on the negative paper 
                  backing of the Polaroid film was much more interesting than 
                  the positive. As it developed, the &quot;paper negative&quot;, 
                  as I came to call it, gave a faint sometimes negative sometimes 
                  positive image nearly always displayed the &quot;Sabatier effect&quot; 
                  (commonly called &quot;solarization&quot;). I found it much 
                  more interesting than the positive, &quot;normal&quot;, Polaroid 
                  picture. I was on to something. I suggested to my client we 
                  experiment and try one with these &quot;paper negatives&quot;. 
                  She agreed. It changed the look of the report and sent me in 
                  a new direction photographically. <br>
                  <br>
                  Originally, I re-photographed the Polaroid paper negative on 
                  high-contrast black and white negative film and then reprinted 
                  this image as silver gelatin. For the next few years, I experimented 
                  with contrast negative masks and darkroom manipulation. Although 
                  I produced a number of award-winning images with these methods, 
                  by 1994, I thought I had reached a technical dead-end. The potential 
                  image I saw in these paper negatives was just out of my technical 
                  reach. Rather like the sculptor who &quot;sees&quot; the image 
                  in the piece of granite and works to let it out, I saw the finished 
                  image in the faint paper negative but lacked the means to bring 
                  it out. <br>
                  <br>
                  By the mid 90s, the digital darkroom opened up possibilities 
                  to me and provided tools to achieve my creative vision that 
                  had been limited by the conventional darkroom. The original 
                  Polaroid stayed the same, however, I was able to achieve the 
                  contrast and detail I could only dream about with the re-photographing 
                  process I had previously used. <br>
                  <br>
                  Years more of experimentation have brought me closer to mastering 
                  this capricious process. I continue to learn and work with the 
                  paper negative. <br>
                  <br>
                  Regarding the name, &quot;Illustratype&quot;. I coined the word 
                  in the 90's to give people a handle on the process. I took it 
                  from the Latin, Illustra-, &quot;to enlighten&quot;. I added 
                  &quot;type&quot; in the photographic tradition of &quot;daguerreotype, 
                  tintype, calotype, etc. <br>
