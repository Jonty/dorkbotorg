                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Longer description: I used to go to a lot of raves, and 
                  at every rave you find a few kids who are pressed up against 
                  huge speaker stacks, blowing out their ears, just because they 
                  like the feeling of bass waves against their bodies. I originally 
                  intended the Udderthump to be a portable rave device that would 
                  give dancers that &quot;bass you can feel&quot; experience without 
                  risking hearing damage.</p>
                <p>But what I discovered was that folks who used the Udderthump 
                  at home reported that it put them into profoundly relaxed states. 
                  Why is this? My guess is that when we experience tacticle music, 
                  we pay less attention to the senses we typically employ, and 
                  it puts us in a meditative state. Body-listening isn't just 
                  about crude vibrations, like when a heavy truck rumbles by. 
                  In fact, your body can perceive subtle and musical frequency 
                  changes, just like your ears, only at much lower frequencies.
