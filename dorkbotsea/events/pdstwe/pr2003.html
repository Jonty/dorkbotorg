              <p>(Seattle) <b>GRASSROOTS ART COLLECTIVE dorkbot OPENS MONTH-LONG 
                EXHIBIT AT CENTER ON CONTEMPORARY ART AUGUST 6TH</b> </p>

              <p><b>CoCA</b> (<a href="http://www.cocaseattle.org" target="_blank">http://www.cocaseattle.org</a>) 
                presents &#147;<b>People Doing Strange Things With Electricity</b>&#148;, 
                a month-long show featuring works created by Seattle&#146;s <b>dorkbot</b> 
                community (<a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea" target="_blank">http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea</a>) 
                that use technology (electricity in particular) as an integral 
                and essential component of their creation and display. The exhibition 
                begins on <b>Wednesday</b>, <b>August 6th</b> at <b>8.00 pm</b> 
                with an opening party and continues throughout the month of August 
                until September 3rd. The works shown range from kinetic, interactive, 
                multi-media sculpture to 2D printed images created by autonomous 
                computer graphics software that requires no human input, and a 
                wide spectrum of creativity in between. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first dorkbot (<a href="http://dorkbot.org" target="_blank">http://dorkbot.org</a>) 
                meeting was held four years ago at the Columbia University Computer 
                Music Center in New York City by Douglas Irving Repetto, and &#147;people 
                doing strange things with electricity&#148; has been the tagline 
                for this informal, international group ever since. dorkbot has 
                no fees, no dues, no official membership roster &#150; but on 
                the first Wednesday of every month or thereabouts, in nine cities 
                around the world, artists (sound, image, movement, whatever), 
                engineers, designers, students and other interested parties involved 
                in the creation of electronic art meet to discuss new work or 
                technologies, share ideas, establish collaborative relationships 
                and see the cool things that everyone else is up to. This exhibit 
                aims to represent the diversity of this community, the diversity 
                of the work that the community generates, and, in the spirit of 
                dorkbot, have an excellent time to boot. &#147;<b>People Doing 
                Strange Things With Electricity</b>&#148; at CoCA gives 29 local 
                artists whose biographies range from emerging to established, 
                and CoCA&#146;s wide, local audience, the chance to do exactly 
                that.</p>

              <p><i>Center on Contemporary Art (CoCA) serves the Pacific Northwest 
                as a catalyst and forum for the advancement, development, and 
                understanding of contemporary art. CoCA provides opportunities 
                for the art audience in this region to view new and experimental 
                artwork firsthand in exhibitions which show the work of international, 
                national and local artists. CoCA is committed to exploring issues, 
                media, and concepts relevant to the world and times in which we 
                live. Site-specific installations, performance art, multi-media 
                and multi-disciplinary programs, and gallery exhibitions of visual 
                art are all within the focus of the organization. CoCA is committed 
                to commissioning new work and providing exposure for emerging 
                artists in a variety of media. CoCA's galleries serve as an artistic 
                proving ground resulting in programming that is experimental in 
                nature--an important distinction between CoCA and other visual 
                arts institutions and organizations in this region.</i> </p>
