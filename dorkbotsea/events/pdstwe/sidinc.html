                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Our current work dissects the inner workings-metaphorically 
                  and literally-of the &quot;toy&quot; in a consumer society. 
                  We have disassembled discarded mechanical plush toys in order 
                  to reveal the crude and complicated mechanisms that make them 
                  tick. These disposable items are familiar objects that propose 
                  interplay of education, communication, and entertainment. The 
                  plush toy and its construction are based on recurrent action. 
                  Through interaction with the &quot;toy&quot; we allude to a 
                  medium whose golden age was over in a glimmer, where nostalgia 
                  and repetition are commodified but never felt: television. This 
                  medium has had an impact that is so profound and so resolutely 
                  banal that it has removed vulgarity from modern culture. Its 
                  impact has carried over to the Internet whose format derives 
                  much from similar repetitive processes. These concepts of repetition 
                  are sustained through interaction. Similarly, all of our mechanisms 
                  are activated by audience participation - motion, sound, or 
                  touch. The toys repeat a song throughout a choreographed action 
                  making the event incessant. People are asked to question the 
                  nature of their perception during their involvement and are 
                  then forced to evaluate the illusory nature of technology and 
                  the reality of its persistence. By transforming a familiar object 
                  that has an aesthetic interface that people are entirely disinterested 
                  in, paring that interface down to it's truest form, people are 
                  then asked to reevaluate their original experience through continued 
                  activity. We believe that their interest in this repetition 
                  is a sign of success. As with all diversions on the sideshow 
                  of culture, events are sustained by audience desire and are 
                  often the most revealing when they are mindlessly repeated. 
                  The intent is to place the audience in a mesmerized state induced 
                  by optical illusion and sound. We propose that the concept of 
                  these casts of characters engaged in a continuous action does 
                  relate to a dreamy cinematic operation, but it also alludes 
                  to a modern life characterized by escapism, frenzy and consumption. 
                  In a future presentation, we plan to construct our discarded 
                  &quot;toybots&quot; out of sterling silver. This contrast between 
                  the discarded forgotten object and the cherished precious one 
                  underscores our societal contradictions. <br>
