                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>A wall-sized plastic mirror. The mirror is sliced into thin 
                  vertical strips maybe 2&quot; wide, maybe 100 of them, each 
                  strip attached at the top to a moving-coil galvanometer (galvo) 
                  and hanging downwards. Each galvo can deflect its mirror strip 
                  slightly. It's like a venetian blind, but with the plastic strips 
                  running vertically. When turned off, all the plastic strips 
                  are hand-aligned to be flat, so it looks like a huge flat mirror. 
                  Or, if rendered in dark plexiglas, it just looks like a shiny 
                  black wall.</p>
                <p>A PC outputs 100 analog channels, one to each galvo, and each 
                  galvo deflects its mirror strip. So essentially the computer 
                  dynamically sculpts the mirror array into a rippled surface 
                  with moving waves by independantly controlling each galvo (and 
                  each mirror-strip angle). Broad waves and tiny ripples can interpenetrate 
                  and march across the array with different speeds and different 
                  directions. We can create standing waves; bathtub-slosh effects 
                  or &quot;chop.&quot; Invisible winds can blow, riffling the 
                  &quot;water surface.&quot; The system can simulate a falling 
                  stone or a raindrop hitting the &quot;water&quot;, and a correct 
                  ripple-pattern will spread outwards from a point. (Of course 
                  the spreading ripples will be long parallel waves, not the expanding 
                  circles of a real pond.) </p>
                <p>Aside from the software, this is a very simple device, but 
                  nobody in their right mind would ever consider building one. 
                  Laser-control galvos NORMALLY COST $300 EACH WHEN NEW. $30,000 
                  for a hundred of them&#133; <br>
