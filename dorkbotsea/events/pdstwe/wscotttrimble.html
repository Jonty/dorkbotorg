                  fall through and become destroyed by spinning blades. The demolished 
                  landscapes pile up in a clear container. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>For much of my life I have been fascinated by the juxtaposition 
                  and tension between the human-made and natural worlds. The extreme 
                  manifestation of this relationship is the frequently used clich&eacute; 
                  of manipulating nature to the point where the life of the planet 
                  (landscape) is at risk. On the other hand, these &quot;vending 
                  sculptures&quot; may represent our coexistence with nature in 
                  a variety of ways: They could be addressing our continuous attempts 
                  of trying to suppress nature or perhaps show the constant need 
                  for maintenance and lack of adaptation of machines, each representing 
                  our paradoxical relationship with nature. <br>
                  <br>
                  I am also very interested in interactive art where the viewer 
                  contributes to the process of constructing, destructing, and 
                  consuming what lies before them. In this exhibit, the viewer 
                  is able to interact/transact with these vending-sculptures using 
                  coinage. It is in this exchange between the viewer and the art 
                  where the meaning resides. What is important is paying for the 
                  experience and not for the material item that the viewer might 
                  expect. One might ask the question, &quot;how much is an art 
                  experience worth?&quot; or &quot; is art the experience or ownership 
                  of a thing?&quot; The experience must extend beyond the gimmick, 
                  the trivial, and the obvious. The financial contribution into 
                  one of these vending sculptures is key to turning the gears 
                  of the metaphorical machine derived from of our own creation.

                  Most of us cannot resist the temptation of putting tokens of 
                  our worth into a machine that yields an experience that one 
                  might not expect nor have any frame of reference to fully understand 
                  what has happened. We as a culture unconsciously buy into a 
                  contrived system that defines our material, social and spiritual 
                  realities. We may not realize the extent of our investment and 
                  contribution because of our cultural default of being shrouded 
                  in a cloud of materialism and stifled by the sheer quantity 
                  of transactions we make everyday. <br>

                  <b>BIO </b><br>
                  When I was younger, my parents, brother and I lived in a small 
                  rural town northwest of Yosemite. My earliest memories were 
                  of the expansiveness of the wilderness, all of its wildlife, 
                  and extreme weather conditions. I was also very influenced by 
                  the machines that humans have developed to move, build, and 
                  manipulate the landscapes in which we lived. Rusted equipment 
                  and found objects were also quite popular in my estimation and 
                  stood in juxtaposition to this wild setting. The world around 
                  me, and how it was assembled and deconstructed was, and still 
                  is, among many of my fascinations. <br>
                  <br>
                  Some years later our family moved to a more urban, yet sleepy 
                  surf town of Santa Cruz, California. This move exhibited yet 
                  another contrast in my life: rural to urban. A more mechanized 
                  world from that of an organic one, if you will. My internal 
                  desire to constantly draw, design, and build things with whatever 
                  resources were at hand, I began to forge my creativity by way 
                  of painting and sculpture. I eventually received a BFA in Spatial 
                  Arts from San Jose State University in San Jose, California, 
                  and not long after made my way to Seattle to pursue graduate 
                  studies at UW.<br>
