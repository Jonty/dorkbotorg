                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Dialectric: The Space Between Us is a Theremin, which is 
                  an electronic musical instrument invented in 1929, designed 
                  to be played without touching. This variation of the instrument 
                  does away with the instrument's traditional antennas in favor 
                  of allowing the viewer to interact directly with the coils which 
                  are the heart of the system. But these particular coils are 
                  not off-the-shelf electronics, they're handwoven. This father-daughter 
                  artist team is exploring cultural attitudes toward technology, 
                  the physical relationship of the individual to technology, and 
                  their own relationship in their Dialectric series. <br>

                  <b> BIO <br>
                  </b>I am a weaver studying electronics for the last few years. 
                  My father, Lawrence MacCary, is a sculptor and a longtime electronics 
                  experimenter, whose interests span a wide spectrum of electrical 
                  and electronic subjects. His projects are mostly electro-mechanical, 
                  some electro-magnetic, and others are both solid-state and &quot;hollow-state&quot; 
                  based adventures. <br>
                  <br>
                  I am interested in the idea of weaving as a ubiquitous but little-noticed 
                  technology, unvalued while still essential to human survival. 
                  Electronics is another technology that is becoming so omnipresent 
                  and so integrated with our lives that we will soon cease to 
                  notice it. However, electronics is sure to cross the boundary 
                  of our skin, and enter our bodies. Its fields already do. <br>
                  <br>
                  It is this intimate interface between people and technology 
                  that I'm examining in this series of works. Each piece in the 
                  series consists of an electronic component woven of conductive 
                  or resistive materials cast-off by industry, and a circuit designed 
                  around it. By interacting with the weaving the viewer physically 
                  enters the circuit, and the circuit passes through the viewer, 
                  blurring the boundary between them. <br>
                  <br>
                  The title of the series, Dialectric, is taken from the words 
                  dialectic, meaning the juxtaposition or interaction of two conflicting 
                  ideas or forces, and dielectric, an insulating substance or 
                  one in which an electric field can be maintained with a minimum 
                  loss of power. I see these as metaphors for the participants 
                  in an interaction, and the space between them. <br>
                  <br>
                  This series is also an opportunity to collaborate with my father, 
                  and I see the works as metaphors for aspects of our relationship, 
                  and relationships in general. <br>
