                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Sound installation work presents many interesting problems 
                  in its execution. First, there is the problem of what defines 
                  installation work and makes it different from a performed work. 
                  Then there comes the problem of pre-recorded sound work or interactive 
                  work. That is where the theremin comes in. The general nature 
                  of the theremin- an electronic instrument that acutely shows 
                  a relation to physical movement and sound- makes it an ideal 
                  solution to the problem of interactivity versus pre-recorded 
                  sound work. By combining the natural abilities of the theremin 
                  with the capacity for real time manipulation of samples and 
                  electronic synthesis of Max/MSP computer software, the work 
                  becomes able to involve the whole space by inviting people to 
                  walk through the entire space, with their proximity to the two 
                  steel rods changing the processing of the sounds as the movements 
                  occur. <br>
