                  </b>A kinetic piece consisting of a series of cubes, gears and 
                  swinging hammers; driven by MOTORWORKS, a V-8 motor, built of 
                  2&quot; x 4&quot; studs and powered by an electric motor that 
                  is slowed by transferring its energy through a series of bicycle 
                  gears, and then to a drive shaft with pistons connected. (MOTORWORKS. 
                  2001. Wood. Steel. Chain. Sprockets. Motor. 96&quot; x 48&quot;

                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>There are many ways to accomplish the goal of making something 
                  move, from using motors to relying on gravity. I am interested 
                  in using as many solutions as I can come up with. The final 
                  reward is seeing and enjoying the motion. I have been inspired 
                  by industry for as long as I can remember, the process of production 
                  and the mechanics behind it. The idea of from here to there. 
                  Movement and stability are two things that I am striving for, 
                  guided by geometry and the way numbers relate to each other.
