                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>The phrase 'everyone's a critic' is never more true than 
                  in the art world. Many viewers are often quick to judge the 
                  artwork before giving themselves a chance to truly observe the 
                  art and explore it's messages. My project &quot;Ay, Tu Apestas!&quot; 
                  (Oh, You Stink!) evaluates the judgmental relationship that 
                  occurs between the viewer and the work from the paintings perspective. 
                  Literally turning up it's nose, the artwork rotates about the 
                  room observing the audience. Metal and acrylic have been incorporated 
                  into the piece to express the resiliency of one's convictions, 
                  canvas to express how judgments are woven into our existence, 
                  and electricity to emphasize the power of opinion. <br>
