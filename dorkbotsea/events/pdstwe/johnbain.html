                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Autocaster is a six channel sound installation utilizing 
                  six digital sample registers, auto-composing a total of one-hundred-and-twenty 
                  sound fragments of an average length of twenty-four seconds 
                  for a total of forty-eight minutes of sound. An array of six 
                  motion sensors is added so that the audience participates in 
                  the composition by just walking around while hearing the piece. 
                  This piece will never exactly repeat itself for the duration 
                  of the exhibit. Autocaster was originally designed for the Polestar 
                  Music Gallery for incidental sound between performances so that 
                  the audience becomes the performers. It has also been used by 
                  acoustic improvisational musicians for interaction while they 
                  move about the space and play their instruments. <br>

                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>Sound artist John Bain (AKA Mutant Data Orchestra) has a 
                  background in architecture and is currently working with sonic 
                  environments both as performances and installations. The basis 
                  of his work deals with issues of auto-composition and the real-time 
                  interaction between humans and machines. His performances with 
                  Mutant Data Orchestra utilize modified digital electronics where 
                  a real-time balance is achieved between the performer and machine 
                  in an improvisational setting. Similar tactics are used for 
                  his installation work, except that the audience becomes the 
                  performer. <br>
