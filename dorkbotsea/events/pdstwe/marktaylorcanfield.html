                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>My sound and video art is a marriage of musique conrete 
                  and collage in the grand French tradition, combined with experimental 
                  images on digital video. It is intended to draw the participant 
                  into a dream state of subconscious symbols and sound - a hypnogogic 
                  hallucinatory experience which is unique to each individual. 
                  Sit relax, dream again&#133; <br>
                  <br>
                  I am narcoleptic and am often inspired by hypnogogic visions 
                  to create art which reflects and evokes this kind of altered 
                  state of consciousness. My images and sounds are designed to 
                  affect the part of the mind at the edge of consciousness, in 
                  that timeless non-linear place we call &quot;imagination&quot;. 
                  Images are symbols and are fluid and transformative. One must 
                  rely on an inner sense of knowing to experience this unreality 
                  fully. <br>
                  <br>
                  I hope that each participant can find their own vision in my 
                  work. <br>
                  <br>
                  Technically, I work with many different media, including reel 
                  to reel tape, digital recorders, mini-disk recorders, old records 
                  and cassettes, samples from radio and television, field recordings, 
                  old microphones and speakers, old record players and cassette 
                  decks, found objects, toys, shortwave radios, digital and analog 
                  synthesizers, traditional instruments, spoken word, electronics, 
                  sound creation and editing software, digital camera and video 
                  mixing console, and the usual digital recording equipment, mixing 
                  board, etc. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b> STATEMENT <br>
                  </b>As a composer and multi-media artist working in the areas 
                  of experimental electronic sound and video, my mission is to 
                  create works that help expand the definition of what is commonly 
                  referred to as &quot;music&quot; and &quot;film&quot;. My current 
                  definition of music and sound art is: pressure waves in air. 
                  As far as &quot;film&quot; is concerned, I believe that it covers 
                  any form of playing with moving colour, light and shadow that 
                  can be captured and reproduced. Through the composition of tape 
                  music, computer music, musique concrete, sound collage, and 
                  experimental video, I am exploring the far reaches of inner 
                  space where the freedom of expression is open for expansion 
                  and the esoteric ideas are ready to be plucked like a juicy 
                  fruit from the tree of knowledge. <br>
                  <br>
                  I am committed to the presentation of collaborative multi-media 
                  performances and recording projects as a way of moving western 
                  civilization along at least in a modest way toward realization 
                  of the inner world of art and dreams. If I can inspire a few 
                  brave souls to look beyond the fringes of art and science and 
                  see a totally new vision, it will have been worth it all. <br>

                  <b>BIO </b><br>
                  Mark Taylor-Canfield is a well-known figure in the Seattle area. 
                  Sometimes controversial, he has always managed to stir up the 
                  political and arts scene and over the years he has developed 
                  a reputation for challenging the status quo. His arrest onstage 
                  during his own performance at Seattle Symphony's Benaroya Hall 
                  is the stuff of legends and has inspired performance art pieces 
                  and numerous articles and essays. Mark had planned to protest 
                  the state of the arts in Seattle and the lack of public funding, 
                  specifically targeting the Mayor's Arts Task Force which never 
                  really accomplished anything to help local artists. In fact, 
                  Seattle Mayor Paul Schell had vetoed or shelved all of the group's 
                  proposals.</p>
                <p>In the ensuing controversy, Taylor-Canfield was arrested before 
                  he could actually perform the world premier of his solo piano 
                  piece, &quot;Catharsis&quot;, because of slanderous rumors that 
                  he planned to destroy the Symphony's expensive concert grand 
                  piano. He had denied the rumors all along, but someone decided 
                  he was just a little too political and the rest is history. 
                  Of course, no charges were ever filed since he broke no laws. 
                  All he did was step onto the stage. The film of his arrest, 
                  by the way, was featured on local news programs and the Seattle 
                  Weekly headlined<br>
                  their story, &quot;Composer Nabbed, Piano Saved&quot;. <br>
