                  DESCRIPTION <br>
                  </b>Reading occupies center stage in our technological society. 
                  It is more ubiquitous and more necessary than computers, electricity, 
                  or the automobile. It is far older, and has become interwoven 
                  with every aspect of our daily lives. Reading is intrinsic to 
                  the ways we share knowledge, the ways we entertain ourselves, 
                  and how we manage our social, political, economic, and educational 
                  systems. Reading continually changes; it adapts to whatever 
                  technological or social changes come along. When the practice 
                  of reading changes, over time or across cultures, people's ideas 
                  about reading and writing also shift. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Listen Reader is designed to explore one possible intersection 
                  of technology with reading. The Listen Reader is a personal 
                  interactive reading experience that combines the look and feel 
                  of a real book - a beautiful cover, paper pages and printed 
                  images and text - with the rich, evocative quality of a movie 
                  soundtrack. It is designed to preserve and even heighten the 
                  experience of immersive reading. It explores the idea of multi-modal 
                  reading: the use of music and sound (but not spoken word) to 
                  provide a sense of place, and to add emotional affect to the 
                  experience of reading a book without interrupting the flow of 
                  the story. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Listen Reader preserves the beauty of the book as token 
                  object. The design uses no LCD or pixeled screen, but traditional, 
                  richly colored printed pages and a classic immersive reading 
                  environment: a comfortable chair, a polished hardwood swing-arm 
                  reading stand, a pool of light in an otherwise shadowed corner. 
                  The soundtrack is controlled by the motion of the reader's hands 
                  in the air above the page. The natural gestures of the reader 
                  turning the pages can provide a simple soundtrack; more complex, 
                  deliberate gesturing allows the reader to create richer soundscapes.

              <p><b>BIO <br>
                </b>Maribeth Back is a researcher and designer who builds and 
                writes about real-world, socially informed exploratory applications 
                for new technologies. She is especially interested in multi-sensory 
                systems integrating sonic and haptic elements in wireless, networked 
                tools and environments. Recent projects include prototyping new 
                types of reading devices as well as designing innovative interfaces 
                for wireless systems in everyday activity. Her background includes 
                theory and audio system design for virtual and computational environments 
                as well as sound design and engineering for music, live theatre, 
                radio, museums and CD-ROM. She has created prototypes of experimental 
                instruments; informatics for advanced medical research systems; 
                and public interactive installations, both solo and collaborative. 
                She has also built a number of innovative electronic reading devices, 
                exploring the intersections between digital systems and the reading 
                and writing of text. Back completed her doctorate at Harvard's 
                Graduate School of Design in May 1996. As a Senior Research Scientist 
                at Xerox PARC (1996 - 2002) she worked with the RED group exploring 
                emerging technologies. <br>
                <br>
                The Listen Reader was designed and built as part of a larger museum 
                exhibit called &quot;XFR: Experiments in the Future of Reading.&quot; 
                My thanks to colleagues Jonathan Cohen Steve Harrison, and Rich 
                Gold who contributed in the building of the Listen Reader system. 
                The XFR show was exhibited in San Jose's Tech Museum of Innovation 
                in 2000 and is now touring to science and technology museums in 
                the U.S.<br>
