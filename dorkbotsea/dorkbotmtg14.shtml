                    <p><b>Iole Alessandrini</b>: Born and raised in Italy, Iole 
                      Alessandrini is an artist who has been living in Seattle 
                      since 1994. She received her diploma in Fine Arts from the 
                      First State School of Fine Arts in Rome and earned two master's 
                      degrees in Architecture: one from the University of La Sapienza 
                      in Rome and the other from the University of Washington 
                      in Seattle. It is the intersection between these two creative 
                      expressions &#150; art and architecture &#150; through which 
                      her work moves. &quot;Through manipulation of light, digital 
                      media and physical space, I design and build ephemeral, 
                      controlled environments that people enter rather than observe 
                      from a distance. Light is energy: waves and particles of 
                      infinitesimal dimensions that are made visible by boundaries. 
                      Architecture is movement: a powerful and meaningful symbol 
                      that redefines space and invents new functions. Physical 
                      space in its states of transformation solicits emotional 
                      feelings and brings back memories. Light, being a remote 
                      projection from a time of which we have no memory, challenges 
                      these feelings and moves our emotions and ideas forward.&quot; 
                      The works' environmental scale, its existence in public 
                      space, and its interactive structure are a few marks of 
                      Alessandrini's work. In 1995, with Art In The Park, Alessandrini 
                      took advantage of her studies on natural phenomena such 
                      as light, shadows, and reflections and used them to provide 
                      an ordinary natural background and relative darkness for 
                      an outdoor site-specific video installation. The project 
                      won her a NIAUSI fellowship and the design was presented 
                      in a lecture format at the Seattle Art Museum in 1966. In 
                      Winter, Season Of Light (2000), Alessandrini designed and 
                      built a virtual landscape that stretched 700 feet long and 
                      100 feet high built of panels, light, and water to reveal 
                      the absent life and the physical void left behind after 
                      the demolition of a section of downtown Tacoma. In Seattle, 
                      she also designed and built Aqua Pura Vista (2000), a light, 
                      video, and sound installation that occupied an early 20th 
                      century water tower in Capitol Hill. Natural sunlight and 
                      shadows cast patterns on the installation, already a digital 
                      representation of the surrounding nature and architecture 
                      of the tower.</p>
                    <p>Alessandrini's work has been supported through grants, 
                      resources, and ideas from: 911 Media Arts Center, the Bellevue 
                      Art Museum, the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs (formerly 
                      Seattle Arts Commission), the Cultural Development Authority 
                      of King County (formerly King County Arts Commission), the 
                      Tacoma Arts Commission and others. She is the recipient 
                      of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2002), the Betty 
                      Bowen Award (2000), the Artists Trust Fellowship (2000), 
                      and the NIAUSI Fellowship (1996). Currently she is a New 
                      Media Artist in Residence at Jack Straw Productions.</p>
