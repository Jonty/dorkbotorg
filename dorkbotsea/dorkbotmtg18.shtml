                    <p><b>Eric McNeill</b> has long been interested in how technology 
                      can be used to represent and reflect on human emotions and 
                      understanding. Most technology is used simply for control, 
                      but when repurposed for artistic use it can provide insights 
                      similar to and beyond that of other media. For the past 
                      several years Eric has focused on pieces that distill information 
                      into their elemental bits, and this series of LED works 
                      is a study in how we recognize meaning from the barest amount 
                      of information.<br>

                      <b>W. Scott Trimble</b>: &quot;When I was younger, my parents, 
                      brother and I lived in a small rural town northwest of Yosemite. 
                      My earliest memories were of the expansiveness of the wilderness, 
                      all of its wildlife, and extreme<br>
                      weather conditions. I was also very influenced by the machines 
                      that humans have developed to move, build, and manipulate 
                      the landscapes in which we lived. Rusted equipment and found 
                      objects were also quite popular in my estimation and stood 
                      in juxtaposition to this wild setting. The world around 
                      me, and how it was assembled and deconstructed was, and 
                      still is, among many of my fascinations. <br>
                      <br>
                      Some years later our family moved to a more urban, yet sleepy 
                      surf town of Santa Cruz, California. This move exhibited 
                      yet another contrast in my life: rural to urban. A more 
                      mechanized world from that of an organic one, if you will. 
                      My internal desire to constantly draw, design, and build 
                      things with whatever resources were at hand, I began to 
                      forge my creativity by way of painting and sculpture. I 
                      eventually received a BFA in Spatial Arts from San Jose 
                      State University in San Jose, California, and not long after 
                      made my way to Seattle to earn an<br>
                      MFA in Sculpture at UW. Both institutions are recognized 
                      for their emphasis in the metal arts, as well as providing 
                      opportunity to explore various processes and concepts. Primarily 
                      a metal fabricator, I have also dealt with a wide range 
                      of materials and processes including, metal casting, woodcarving, 
                      digital media, cast materials, mold making, photography 
                      and automated sculpture. In the late 1990's I co-founded, 
                      built and maintained a metal fabrication and bronze-casting 
                      studio in Santa Cruz, California. I have also exhibited 
                      in many selected solo and<br>
                      group exhibitions throughout the west coast.&quot;<br>
