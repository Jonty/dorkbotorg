  <h2><br />Peter Brown and Juice Box: <a href="http://blogsicle.net/pages/assimilator">The Assimilator Project</a></h2>
  <p>
   <a href="http://blogsicle.net/files/systems_layout.png"><img src="images/db33-assimilator_schematic125x140.jpg" width="125" height="140" alt="The Assimilator Project: schematic" class="right" /></a>
   The goal was to enable people to have a first-person perspective of being 500 feet in the air, without the pesky need to get in a helicopter or air plane.
   <a href="http://blog.realityallstarz.com/pages/about"><img src="images/db33_ptb176x144.jpg" width="176" height="144" alt="Peter Brown" class="left" /></a>
   The project used simple off the shelf wireless video equipment, LCD video goggles, lots of string, and a large helium balloon.  Put on the goggles and see what the balloon would see as it rises and falls.  The project got an art grant from Ignition Northwest for its maiden voyage at Critical Massive and was taken to Burning Man this summer.

   Peter Brown is a software entrepreneur working on web technologies in Seattle. This is his first "art" project.

  <h2><br />Ryan Weh and Brad Larsen: Radio-Controlled Blimp-Mounted Camera</h2>
  <p>
   Brad and Ryan have been interested in radio control flying toys for a very long time.  They'd always enjoyed the thought of getting aerial videos from a radio control airplane, and only fairly recently come up with a working setup that satisfies their basic objectives, even though they have been slowly working on the problem of sending up a wireless camera from an airship for some time.  In fact, the camera part turned out to be easy and relatively cheap, but the biggest holdup was in finding a way to view or record the video from the ground (or both), on the field with minimal backup power.  At the meeting they'll talk about the issues that they came across when trying the various camera systems, and  how they converged onto the solution that they are using now.  They will also cover some other issues with using the camera itself, such as some basic vibration damping advice.
  </p>

  <p>
   Brad Larsen is an industrial designer and an inventor with his name on various patents.  He currently develops toy airplanes new pepper grinders and other inventions.
  </p>

  <p>
   Ryan Weh is a student in Physics at the UW.  He has a <a href="http://www.quixotism.org/">personal website</a>, and hosts <a href="http://www.theidea.bz/forums/wsci/">a forum</a> for Bill Beaty's Amasci website.
