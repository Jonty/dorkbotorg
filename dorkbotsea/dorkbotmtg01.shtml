                      loud, large, elegantly austere machines and talking about 
                      aesthetic movement: “there is movement all around us, every 
                      day, everywhere we go. from cars driving by, to cranes lifting 
                      material, to cargo ships coming in to port. most of which 
                      we take for granted, because it is normal everyday life. 
                      if you ever stop to look and take in what is happening around 
                      you, you may see the beauty in the mundane movements from 
                      here to there. inspired by industry, and machinery of all 
                      sorts, my work seeks to show the beauty of movement in simple 
                      actions, such as a hammer swing.”.</p>

                      CA-based researcher and designer Maribeth Back <b><a href="http://xenia.media.mit.edu/%7Embb/" target="_blank">http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~mbb/</a></b></a> 
                      will be talking about her work in the field of multi-sensory 
                      design and the intersection of technology with reading: 
                      “The Listen Reader is a personal interactive reading experience 
                      that combines the look and feel of a real book - a beautiful 
                      cover, paper pages and printed images and text - with the 
                      rich, evocative quality of a movie soundtrack. It is designed 
                      to preserve and even heighten the experience of immersive 
                      reading. It explores the idea of multi-sensory reading: 
                      the use of background sound to provide a sense of place, 
                      and to add affect to the experience of reading a book without 
                      interrupting the flow of the story. The Listen Reader also 
                      preserves the beauty of the book as token object, embedded 
                      in a classic immersive reading environment: a comfortable 
                      chair, a polished hardwood swing-arm reading stand, a pool 
                      of light in an otherwise shadowed corner. The soundtrack 
                      is controlled by the motion of the reader's hands above 
                      the page; any motion within eight inches of the sensors 
                      is read as a volume, pitch, or pan control. Embedded RFID 
                      tags were used to sense the page looked at, and capacitive 
                      field sensors measure human proximity to the pages. Proximity 
                      measurements control volume and other expressive parameters 
                      of the sounds associated with each page.”.</p>

                    <p> Speeder Reader provides speed reading with speed racing 
                      controls, combining dynamic typography with a driving interface. 
                      A speed-reading protocol called RSVP (for Rapid Serial Visual 
                      Presentation) can allow people to learn to read up to 2000 
                      words per minute. In Speeder Reader, a gas pedal controls 
                      the rate of speed-reading and a steering wheel navigates 
                      between streams of text. Speeder Reader is designed not 
                      only to illustrate a different method of text reading, but 
                      to provide a metaphor about personal control over the powerful 
                      medium of text: driving is a enabling tool for people in 
                      our culture.</p>
