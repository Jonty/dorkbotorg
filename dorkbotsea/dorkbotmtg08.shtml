                            culmination of this effort is a new form of live experience

                      using interference patterns generated by two waveforms, 
                      using the timeline in Digital Performer as a repository

                      in the sequence time line, and the new location sends controller 
                      info that changes the parameters of the self oscillating 
                      plugin. He&#146;ll also be working with solenoids, which
