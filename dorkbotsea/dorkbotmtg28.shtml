                      and Eli Sohl on the Vex Robotics Systems<br>
                      </strong>Norm is a long time programmer with experience 
                      in mobile devices and 3D graphics. His 12.75 year old son 
                      Eli has a background in game programming and Lego Mindstorms. 
                      They've done several projects together, including converting 
                      an old BattleZone arcade control to work with a PC emulator, 
                      and building a Theremin.<br>
                      In their robotic competitions, Eli usually wins. Recently 
                      Norm and Eli have been experimenting with the VEX Robotics 
                      Systems, and will present their findings on the good and 
                      bad of VEX (why do they call it VEX?). They'll demo their 
                      custom RC robots and provide an overview of the VEX starter 
                      kits, retail expansion kits, programming systems and <strong><a href="http://www.vexlabs.com/" target="_blank">VexLABS</a></strong>

                      Schilling and Gus Jansson on Lego Mindstorms</strong><br>
                      David Schilling and Gus Jansson started <a href="http://news.lugnet.com/org/us/smart/" target="_blank"><strong>SMART</strong></a>, 
                      the Seattle Mindstorms And Robotic Techies, about five years 
                      ago for people interested in the LEGO Mindstorms robotic 
                      system. The purpose of the group is to give people a reason 
                      to use their Mindstorms kits, a place to show their creations 
                      to others, and a place to learn about building and programming 
                      their robots. Since the best way to learn something is by 
                      doing it, each meeting is focused on a 'mini-challenge' 
                      - a simple task that everyone is encouraged to attempt. 
                      SMART also puts on public robotic displays from time to 
                      time. Last year LEGO started work on a new robotic system 
                      to replace the RCX. Among a very small handful of adult 
                      Mindstorms fans, they called on David and Gus to participate 
                      in a secret group that provided input in the system they 
                      were designing. Not only did they get to see early prototypes 
                      and a chance to try out the system ahead of time, but they 
                      were able to affect some very important changes to the final 
                      system.</p>
