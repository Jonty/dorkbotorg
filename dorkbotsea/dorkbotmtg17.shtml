                      Objectivism, Kinetic Text and the Corporeal</i>: How do 
                      a poet and a programmer enable us to experience another's 
                      memories? Can computer programming serve to create a coherent 
                      physical reality and at the same time create poetry, which 
                      occurs in the interstices between memory and reality? In 
                      this presentation, poet Michael Evan and artist/programmer 
                      Randy Moss talk about their experience creating &quot;Afterwords,&quot; 
                      an interactive installation that examines personal identity, 
                      labels and the ephemera of the digital age. Afterwords encourages 
                      visitors to explore a living body of memory, providing an 
                      open space in which meaning is made through words, presence 
                      and movement. The pair will discuss their use of pervasive 
                      computing technology and explain how the installation extends 
                      the tradition of American Objectivist poetry into the interactive 
                      realm. They will also highlight some of the challenges they 
                      faced collaborating remotely on a piece that is firmly rooted 
                      in the physical. <a href="http://rmoss.com" target="_blank"><b>http://rmoss.com</b></a>
