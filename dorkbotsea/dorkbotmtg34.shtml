  <h2><b>James Gwertzman</b>, Director of Business Development, <a href="http://www.popcap.com">PopCap Games, Inc.</a></h2>
  <p>
   You should be making casual games!
  </p>

  <p>
   <img src="images/db34_zuma.jpg" width="262" height="197" alt="Zuma" class="left" />
   The casual game industry has erupted out of nowhere in the past few years to become a major piece of the overall game industry, with revenues projected to top $1B by 2008. Small, addictive, fun, and aggressively mass-market, casual games are not only good business but they're also incredibly fun to produce. Who wants to spend years being part of a 100+ person team building a giant "blockbuster" game that will cost so much to build that its publisher is unwilling to take any creative risks, when you could be producing the equivalent of an "art house" film - a small, tight, creative game that will live and die in the market entirely by the merits of its actual game-play? And quite literally do so at home in the garage, with a very real chance at being successful?
  </p>

  <p>
   <img src="images/db34_bejeweled.jpg" width="262" height="197" alt="Bejeweled" class="right" />
   Come to this talk to learn more about casual games, and also to get an overview of tools & resources available to you for free to help get you started creating the next great gaming masterpiece at home in your free time. James Gwertzman is the Director of Business Development for PopCap games, one of the leading casual game developers and publishers, but he's also got first-hand experience as an "indie" developer in this space, having co-founded Sprout Games (a small and successful casual game developer) prior to its acquisition by PopCap. As part of this talk James will also share some of the techniques that PopCap uses in developing its own best-selling casual games such as Bejeweled or Zuma.

  <h2><b>Ruth Fruland</b>, Ph.D., Research Associate, Human Interface Technology Lab (HITL), and Regional Coordinator, <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change</a></h2>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/db34_serious_games.png" width="483" height="150" alt="game screenshot" class="center" /></p>
  <p>
   Ruth Fruland is the Northwest Coordinator of the national Games for Change organization, a subset of the <a href="http://www.seriousgames.org/index2.html">Serious Games</a> movement, and for several years have been spearheading a group called GaSworks, which is an informal group of people who share an interest in Games and Simulations in Education in the Puget Sound area. Her presentation will include some of the games and game concepts that people in this group have developed, in addition to what else is out there, or is on the horizon.
