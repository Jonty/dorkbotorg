                            Reek Havok is widely recognized for his pioneering 
                            work with electronic music instruments and digital 
                            sampling in the music industry over the past 22 years. 
                            Reek shares one of his most unique creations, “Space 
                            Thrust”, with the dorkbot community. Space Thrust 
                            was designed to be a Rave song, originally created 
                            in 1991. Its uniqueness comes in the creation of its 
                            instruments, which comprise sounds that are literally 
                            not from this planet or even our solar system. The 
                            sounds in Space Thrust were derived from recordings 
                            done by Dr. Fiorella Terenzi, an astrophysicist and 
                            composer, for her “Music of the Galaxies” CD. </p>

                            180 million light years from earth. These radio waves, 
                            originally in the gigahertz frequency range, have 
                            been sub-divided many times to bring them into the 
                            range of human hearing. Reek will explain the how 
                            he realized the musical content of these unique sounds 
                            and created 11 unique instruments for utilization 
                            in this piece. Reek will also show some unique Prepared

                          <p>Each year in the spring, Chris Hecker and Sean Barrett 
                            invite professional video game developers from all 
                            over the country to come to a barn in Oakland, California 
                            for the four-day "Indie Game Jam". Each year there 
                            is a central technological theme, and the objective 
                            is to produce as many different, fully playable games 
                            as possible within that theme (and in only the four 
                            days allotted). This year's theme was "games you can 
                            play with your own shadow." The equipment necessary 
                            to play the games is quite simple: a firewire camera, 
                            a projector, and a computer. The projector projects 
                            the games onto a screen, and the player (or players) 
                            stands in between the projector and the screen, thus 
                            injecting their shadow into the game's display. The 
                            firewire camera continuously captures the screen and 
                            feeds the results back to the computer, which the 
                            game uses as input. So, quite literally, you play 
                            each and every game with your shadow - no mice, no 
                            keyboards, no gamepads :) </p>
                          <p> In this 30-minute DorkBot presentation, I will be 
                            demonstrating some selected games from the 14 playable 
                            ones we created. I'll give a brief overview of the 
                            system we used as a harness (called Shadow Garden), 
                            and I'll discuss the lessons we learned about designing 
                            interactivity around the novel input device that is 
                            a player's shadow. And, space permitting, we'll have 
                            a fully running version of a few of the games available 
                            for everyone to play into the wee hours of the night."

                      After only two years in the running, it has already been 
                      widely covered by the gaming press and has inspired similar 
                      events all over the world. The full source code and assets 
                      for all games developed at the Jam are posted to SourceForge 
                      a few months after the Jam concludes. More information about
