AUGUST 6TH TO SEPTEMBER 3RD, 2003:
<br>
dorkbot-sea exhibition at CoCA</p>

<p>
CoCA have asked dorkbot-sea to put on an exhibition in August of this year - and we're up for the challenge.  If you have:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Kinetic sculpture/robots/weird science object or installation 
<li>Other form of exhibit or installation that involves doing something strange with electricity
<li>Musical piece, soundscape etc. that lends itself to a ‘listening booth’-style presentation 
<li>Musical piece, soundscape, audio installation etc. that could be part of the overall exhibition experience 
<li>Digitally manipulated images or images generated by graphics software that you have created
<li>Any other ideas
</ul></p>

<p> 
Please let <a href=mailto:dorkbotsea@dorkbot.org>Kate and Kathy</a> know as soon as possible so we can start talking with you.</p>

COMING SOON:
<br>
911 Media Arts Center special dorkbot-sea screening</p>

<p>
A potential opportunity for video artists:  911 Media Arts Center is considering giving us the opportunity to show the work of dorkbot-sea video artists as part of their upcoming summer quarter special screening schedule.  One entire Friday evening screening could be ours!  Again, we’ll discuss this opportunity at the first dorkbot-sea meeting in June, but in the meantime, if you have:</p>

<p> <ul>
<li>A short video or animation piece 
<li>A longer video or animation piece that could be excerpted if necessary 
<li>A longer video or animation piece that you don’t want to be excerpted 
<li>Any other ideas that involve doing strange things with electricity in a screenable way</p> </ul>

<p> 
Please let <a href=mailto:dorkbotsea@dorkbot.org>Kate and Kathy</a> know as soon as possible so we can start talking with you.
</p>


<p class=dash>Disclaimer:  beginning discussions with you, sharing ideas and input and so forth about either of the above opportunities does not mean that a) they’ll end up happening during the period currently under discussion, b) they’ll end up happening at all or c) your work will be included should they take place.  Right now, we’re in the very early planning stages – but we’re looking forward to your feedback and potential involvement!</p>
