                      Seattle artist and weaver Laura MacCary and her father and 
                      collaborator, Spokane sculptor, poet and electronics expert 
                      Lawrence MacCary, will be talking about the hows and whys 
                      of their series of interactive artworks combining weaving 
                      and electronics. They will also unveil a new piece for the 
                      first time. Each piece in the series consists of an electronic 
                      component woven of conductive or resistive materials cast 
                      off by industry, and a circuit designed around the weaving. 
                      By interacting with the weaving the viewer physically enters 
                      the circuit, and the circuit passes through the viewer, 
                      blurring the boundary between them. The title of the series, 
                      Dialectric, is taken from the words dialectic, meaning the 
                      juxtaposition or interaction of two conflicting ideas or 
                      forces, and dielectric, an insulating substance or one in 
                      which an electric field can be maintained with a minimum 
                      loss of power. Videos of some pieces in the series can be

                      to simple sensors and switches that detect the position 
                      of a magnet. Inside is a lot of science, but from the outside, 
                      they are small, cheap, rugged, have few wires, and are pretty 
                      easy to get along with. They may be a reasonable alternative 
                      to mechanical switches and potentiometers in some things 
                      that move. They can be simpler to use than you might realize.

                      toys, toy instruments and other electronic oddities, appropriating 
                      rather than reinventing the devices to create symphonic

                      toy tambourines, walkie-talkies and so forth. While they 
                      do some basic circuit bending and are working on some custom 
                      amplification setups using old stereos, discarded speakers 
                      and megaphones, their main aim is to see what kind of sound 
                      they can coax out of interesting stock components by working 
                      instinctively rather than tweaking those components into 
                      something else altogether. See and hear the results at this

                    <p> <b>Laura MacCary and Lawrence MacCary</b>: Laura MacCary 
                      is a weaver who has also been studying electronics for the 
                      last few years.Her father, Lawrence MacCary, is a sculptor 
                      and a longtime electronics experimenter, whose interests 
                      span a wide spectrum of electrical and electronic subjects. 
                      His projects are mostly electro-mechanical, some electro-magnetic, 
                      and others are both solid-state and "hollow-state" based 
                      adventures. Laura is interested in the idea of weaving as 
                      a ubiquitous but little-noticed technology, unvalued while 
                      still essential to human survival. Electronics is another 
                      technology that is becoming so omnipresent and so integrated 
                      with our lives that we will soon cease to notice it. However, 
                      electronics is sure to cross the boundary of our skin, and 
                      enter our bodies. Its fields already do. It is this intimate 
                      interface between people and technology that Laura examines 
                      in this series of works. Each piece in the series consists 
                      of an electronic component woven of conductive or resistive 
                      materials cast-off by industry, and a circuit designed around 
                      it. By interacting with the weaving the viewer physically 
                      enters the circuit, and the circuit passes through the viewer, 
                      blurring the boundary between them. The title of the series, 
                      Dialectric, is taken from the words dialectic, meaning the 
                      juxtaposition or interaction of two conflicting ideas or 
                      forces, and dielectric, an insulating substance or one in 
                      which an electric field can be maintained with a minimum 
                      loss of power. Laura sees these as metaphors for the participants 
                      in an interaction, and the space between them. This series 
                      is also an opportunity to collaborate with her father, and 
                      she see the works as metaphors for aspects of our relationship, 
                      and relationships in general. </p>
