                      arrival gaspo’s work focuses on bringing art and technology 
                      into a direct interactive experience, using sound, motion, 
                      light and radio to stimulate and scramble the senses. gaspo 
                      (aka Scott Gasparian) will be presenting an overview of 
                      using microcontrollers in art applications. Opening with 
                      a video of the mad-scientists project "L2K" which has been 
                      installed at the Burning Man festival since 1999, his presentation 
                      will include demonstrations of the "colour" version of the 
                      L2K protocol. To demonstrate the interactivity focus of 
                      his art, he will be showing the blades to the 10 foot "HypKnowTron"

                      and a live deomonstration of the recently completed "minitron". 
                      This talk will be suitable for artists who have no idea 
                      about electricity but would like to include it in their 
                      art, and will illuminate the possibilities of computer controlling 
                      a variety of motors, lights, sensors, and toasters.

                      be dorkier than sharks with laser weapons mounted on their 
                      heads? Why, a video game drawn with a laser beam, of course! 
                      You may know how to make trippy laser images on your wall 
                      by mounting a mirror on your speaker and aiming a laser 
                      pointer at it, but tonight local electronics, computing, 
                      math and radio whiz Steve Safarik will show us how to exhibit 
                      finer control over the beam and draw the precise shapes 
                      needed for his multiplayer space combat game. Spacewars 
                      will be running and playable on the parking lot wall outside 
                      CoCA before and after the meeting (weather permitting, of 
                      course), so come a little early and stay a little late to

                      Seattle-based composer, sound designer and computer programmer, 
                      Jeremy Winters, has been evolving his master project, the 
                      Mood Channel, for 7 years. Most of this time has been spent 
                      daydreaming and fantasizing about futuristic living where 
                      music, lighting and interior decor have blended together 
                      to interface with our emotions. Jeremy will be discussing 
                      some of the basic concepts behind the generative music that 
                      he uses, and share some of the Mood Channel’s inner workings. 
                      He will also be showing some of the newer programs that 
                      he is creating. (<a href=http://www.madnessmachine.com/><b>http://www.madnessmachine.com/</b></a>).<br>
