   We have machines that go PING!, machines that record the other machines going PING!, and machines to turn that PING! into all manner of wonderful sounds.  But how do we turn all these possibilities into something beautiful?  This month, Dorkbot will hear from three speakers with experience and insight into the art of sound, from composing with operating system sounds through capturing the sound environment of a place to creating sound environments for people to experience.

   Jim has been writing music for over 25 years. At 18 he created 7 albums of songs using a cassette recorder and making album covers on cardboard sheets. They were mostly terrible, but he still has all of them. He also wrote two comic book operas, where you listen as you read, and created another opera from the text of a Star Trek episode (&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_dove">Day of the Dove</a>&quot;, if anyone is interested.) Since then he spent most of his music time writing for musical theatre, and had shows produced in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. His styles range from lounge to novelty to classical. Most recently, as Jim of Seattle, Jim has been winning songwriting competitions for an online songwriting site (<a href="http://www.songfight.org/">www.songfight.org</a>). More of his music can be found at <a href="http://www.jimofseattle.com/">www.jimofseattle.com</a>. Jim originated and produced Opening Windows, a CD of songs by Microsoft employees to benefit the <a href="http://www.unitedway.org/">United Way</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jim works as a technical account manager for Microsoft.

   Mike will tell us more about his <a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/events/pdstwe3/">Strange Things</a> submission&mdash;<a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsea/events/pdstwe3/mikemccracken.html">Audible Avatar</a>&mdash;an art project that uses software to monitor movement in a space, attaching sounds to people as they move and creating an acoustic representation of the activity in the space. SuperCollider records audio input and generates the soundscape over four channels; an Arduino takes input from and provides feedback to the kiosk to facilitate the recording; and a camera connected to MAX/MSP/Jitter using Computer Vision for image analysis and custom Java software to process the information sends commands to SC via OSC. The result is an undulating ambient soundscape filled with entities that follow people around, modulating as they move.
