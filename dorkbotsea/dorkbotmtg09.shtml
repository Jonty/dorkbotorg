                      the &#147;9 Evenings&#148; Artists &amp; Engineers Collaborations&#148;</i>: 
                      In the mid-twentieth century, artists of all genres (dancers, 
                      painters, sculptors, musicians) worked with many forms of 
                      new and &#147;old&#148; communications technologies &#150; 
                      film, early video, computers, audio and radio electronics, 
                      etc. They found a champion in Billy Kluver, a Bell Labs 
                      engineer. His collaborations with Jean Tingley, Andy Warhol, 
                      Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg in the early 1960s 
                      led to the 1966 &#147;9 Evenings of Theatre and Engineering&#148; 
                      event in New York City. Convinced there was a need for an 
                      information clearinghouse to make technical information 
                      and advice available and a service for arranging individual 
                      artist-engineer collaborations, Experiments in Art and Technology 
                      (E.A.T.) was then founded by a group of artists and engineers 
                      led by Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Whitman, Billy Kluver 
                      and Fred Waldhauer. With 28 chapters founded by regional 
                      artists and engineers across the U.S., E.A.T. represented 
                      a new vision in the late 1960s to expand the artist&#146;s 
                      role in contemporary society and eliminate the separation 
                      of the individual from technological change. Seattle and 
                      Portland formed E.A.T. chapters that brought together local 
                      visual, media, and performing artists with engineers from 
                      Boeing and other regional technology companies in the summer

                      and sculptor, then began collaborating with dancers, musicians, 
                      and filmmakers during this period. She was the principal 
                      E.A.T. artist in Seattle who understood the collaborative 
                      process and made the necessary connections to create new 
                      works like a dance piece that incorporated her large 3-dimensional 
                      sculptures as part of an opera for children (&#147;Mantra&#148;) 
                      and a computer-drawn series of circles that was transferred 
                      to film and colorized (&#147;Circles&#148;, see still above) 
                      by Seattle filmmakers Robert Brown and Frank Olvey, and 
                      set to music by Morton Subotnick. To create Circles, engineer 
                      William Fetter arranged for Chase to use the computer graphics 
                      software/hardware system he had been developing at the Boeing 
                      Company. &#145;Circles&#146; was an artistic application 
                      of computer graphics programming accomplished with the assistance 
                      of Robert Tingley, who worked with Fetter at Boeing.</p>

                      for over forty-five years. A native of Seattle, she studied 
                      architecture at the University of Washington, worked as 
                      a painter for fifteen years, then as a sculptor for a decade

                      are world-renown. Of her work in video, the New York Times 
                      notes, &quot;Her work is at once delicate and massive...as 
                      visual experience, it is ravishing.&quot; Chase's newest 
                      work in glass and steel has shown at Friesen Gallery in 
                      Seattle and Sun Valley, Idaho. She has worked with architects, 
                      museum curators, filmmakers, actors, writers and dancers 
                      to develop commissioned projects for museums and public 
                      agencies. Her prolific career in the visual arts has made 
                      her a leading lecturer across the country. <a href="http://friesengallery.com/artists/bio/chase_bio.html"><b>http://friesengallery.com/artists/bio/chase_bio.html</b></a>
