                      writer Chris DeLaurenti’s work incorporates unusual field 
                      recordings as well as stolen and found sounds. As a music 
                      writer, Chris writes a weekly column for the Stranger, “the 
                      score”, which covers classical, jazz and their respective 
                      as well as collective experimental progeny. Chris will discuss 
                      the history of repurposed sonic materials from Paul Hindemith 
                      and Ernest Toch in 1920’s Berlin through Cage, Tenney, Stockhausen 
                      and others. He’ll play short excerpts, outline a rough history 
                      and comment on the practices and pitfalls of creating such 
                      work. His site, <a href=http://www.delaurenti.net/><b>http://www.delaurenti.net/</b></a>,

                    <p> <b>Otis Fodder</b>, <i>"Listening, Appropriating and Sharing"</i>: 
                      Sonicabal founder Otis Fodder mines the aural dustbins of 
                      society and creates new and surprising work with his findings. 
                      An expert, nationally-recognized samplist, his projects 
                      often subvert cultural propaganda by turning it inside out 
                      in humorous and provocative ways. His projects include The 
                      Bran Flakes and 365 Days – a new MP3 file of an obscure 
                      and often out-of-print recording a day for a year. For this 
                      dorkbot meeting, Otis will be sharing both music and memories, 
                      and discussing and playing sampling fodder (digital and 
                      vinyl) for the masses. This fodder will include classic 
                      sampled material in pop and hip-hop and sources to sample 
                      from – from thrift stores to the Main Street. <a href=http://www.otisfodder.com/><b>http://www.otisfodder.com/</b></a>

                      will be making the trip north to talk about recycling culture, 
                      sampling, appropriation, and the legal obstacles to artists 
                      doing work in this field. He will also discuss the history 
                      of Detritus.net and give an overview of other artists represented 
                      there. Steev has been creating experimental music, performance 
                      art, video and internet art since 1990. His work centers 
                      around the appropriation and recontextualization of pre-existing 
                      cultural artifacts – making new art from old. He has presented 
                      his work nationally and internationally, and is also a founding

                      Mutant Data Orchestra) utilizes re-wired digital electronics 
                      to create sonic environments as performances and installations 
                      that deal with issues of autocomposition and the real-time 
                      interaction between humans and machines. John will discuss 
                      his use of "circuit bending" and how this technique re-purposes 
                      socialized home electronics – turning your digital stuff 
                      into something completely different. During the talk, we’ll 
                      be training a video camera on him as he opens up his gear 
                      to show his complex re-wiring methods, the sonic results 
                      of his design decisions and how they influence new, custom 
                      interfaces. Through this sonification, John will show the 
                      two different types of sound that digital memory produces 
                      and explain the decisions he makes when attempting to crack 
                      a new piece of gear without blowing it up or killing himself.

                      At California Institute of the Arts he studied composition 
                      with Morton Subotnick and Wadada Leo Smith, sound design 
                      with Tom Erbe, and cultural studies with Dick Hebdige. Hise's 
                      work centers around the appropriation and recontextualization 
                      of pre-existing cultural artifacts; in other words, making 
                      new art from the old. He has presented his work across North 
                      America and in Europe and Australia, and has collaborated 
                      with a variety of other artists including Wobbly, The Evolution 
                      Control Committee, People Like Us, and the Tape-beatles. 
                      In addition, he has been commisioned to compose music for 
                      several choreographers including Amy Drum and Jeanne Herring. 
                      In 2000 he received the New Langton Bay Area Award for his 
                      internet piece "Detritus Sound Consensus Bakery". Hise's 
                      recordings appear on his CD, "Original" (Illegal Art/Cha-Bashira) 
                      as well as various compilations including "Deconstructing 
                      Beck" (Illegal Art) and "The Toywar Soundtrack" (Etoy). 
                      Hise is a founding steering committee member of the San

                    <p> <b>John Bain</b>: Sound artist John Bain (aka Mutant Data 
                      Orchestra) has a background in architecture and is currently 
                      working with sonic environments both as performances and 
                      installations. The basis of his work deals with issues of 
                      autocomposistion and the realtime interaction between humans 
                      and machines. His performances with Mutant Data Orchestra 
                      utilize modified digital electronics where a realtime balance 
                      is achieved between the performer and machine in an improvisational 
                      setting. Similar tactics are used for his installation work, 
                      except that the audience becomes the performer.</p>
                    <p> <b>Mutant Data Orchestra</b>: The Mutant Data Orchestra 
                      rewires the products of our digital society to expose the 
                      hidden agents within. Through live circuit modification 
                      of digital answering machines, cheap digital toys and sound 
                      instruments the performers manipulate the data pathways 
                      and exert on their sound production without the use of a 
                      conventional software interface. These sonic generators 
                      produce shards of noise with auto-improvised stabs of high 
                      pitched bell and cello tones. At times one can hear the 
                      intermeshing of data as a liquid waterfall of sonic information. 
                      The Mutant Data Orchestra performs with rewired digital 
                      instruments which are designed to occupy a balance between 
                      chaos and control. This attractor is utilized to navigate 
                      improvised compositions toward ideal aesthetics based on 
                      the particular characteristics of each machine. Sonified 
                      data is manipulated through added interfaces and network 
                      capabilities providing new chip to chip connections within 
                      and among individual machines. The artists essentially build 
                      sonic organisms live on stage implying hidden sonic urbanism's 
                      reflecting the micro-urbanism's of the digital chips and 
                      their individual connections. Digital memory does have a 
                      sound and the Mutant Data Orchestra exploits this fact.</p>
