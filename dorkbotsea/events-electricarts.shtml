                  the collective USCO, in collaboration with engineers such as

                  <br>
                  &quot;This tribute is an expressionist documentary of Swiss 
                  motion sculptor Jean Tinguely's auto-destructive sculpture as 
                  it is assembled and then self-destructs at The Museum of Modern 
                  Art. Tinguely's sculpture is an eclectic, massive conglomeration 
                  of wheels, bathtubs, piano strings, pulleys, and airplane parts 
                  that are constantly in motion. Breer overlays segments of the 
                  Homage being set on fire with scenes of the original drawing 
                  plan and welding, and extends his portrait by manipulating his 
                  imagery in kinetic collages which reflect the energy of Tinguely's 
                  work.&quot; (MoMA Circulating Film Library Catalogue) </p>

                  afterwards by the group that included a young Stewart Brand 
                  (Whole Earth Catalogue publisher). Also shown are numerous USCO

                  &quot;'Variations V' is a multi-media work involving sound sensitive 
                  electronic poles placed around the stage. The sound is triggered 
                  by the dancer's movements and then altered or delayed by the 
                  musicians. Filmmaker Stan Vanderbeek recorded rehearsals of 
                  the dancers and then overlayed this footage as well as other 
                  stock footage images in the final film. Composer Nam June Paik 
                  projected these images on television screens during the performance. 
                  Non-dance related activities were also performed. Merce Cunningham 
                  potted a large plant and Carolyn Brown repotted it. The plant 
                  had a microphone attached to it so that any movement would produce 
                  sound. At the end of the piece, Merce Cunningham rode a bicycle 
                  through the space.&quot; (<a href="http://www.merce.org/filmvideo_archival.html" target="_blank"><b>www.merce.org/filmvideo_archival.html</b></a>)</p>

                  Stan Vanderbeek was born in 1927 and died in 1984. &quot;His 
                  early collage animation was created in the spirit of the Surrealist 
                  and Dadaist work of Max Ernst, but with a wild, rough informality 
                  more akin to the expressionism of the Beat Generation&#133; 
                  A pioneer in the development of experimental film and live-action 
                  animation technique, Vanderbeek achieved widespread recognition 
                  in the American avant-garde cinema. An advocate of the application 
                  of a utopian fusion of art and technology, he began making films 
                  in 1955. In the 1960s, he produced theatrical, multimedia pieces 
                  and computer animation, often working in collaboration with 
                  Bell Telephone Laboratories. In the 1970s, he constructed a 
                  'Movie-Drome' in Stony Point, New York, which was an audiovisual 
                  laboratory for the projection of film, dance, magic theater, 
                  sound and other visual effects. His multimedia experiments included 
                  movie murals, projection systems, planetarium events and the 
                  exploration of early computer graphics and image-processing 
                  systems.&quot; (<a href="http://www.eai.org" target="_blank"><b>www.eai.org</b></a>)

                  &quot;In May of 1969, the Howard Wise Gallery in New York presented 
                  'TV as a Creative Medium,' the first exhibition in the U.S. 
                  devoted entirely to video as a form of art. Schneider recorded 
                  this historical document of the landmark exhibition. It features 
                  works such as Nam June Paik's 'Participation TV,' Paul Ryan's 
                  'Everyman's Mobius Strip,' Thomas Tadlock's 'Archetron,' Eric 
                  Siegel's 'Psychedelevision in Color,' Charlotte Moorman's first 
                  performance of Paik's 'TV Bra For Living Sculpture,' and Schneider's
