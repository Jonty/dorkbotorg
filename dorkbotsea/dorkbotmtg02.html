                    <p><b>Reek Havok</b>, <i>‘Space Thrust’</i>: Seattle-based 
                      Reek Havok is widely recognized for his pioneering work 
                      with electronic music instruments and digital sampling in 
                      the music industry over the past 22 years. Reek shares one 
                      of his most unique creations, “Space Thrust”, with the dorkbot 
                      community. Space Thrust was designed to be a Rave song, 
                      originally created in 1991. Its uniqueness comes in the 
                      creation of its instruments, which comprise sounds that 
                      are literally not from this planet or even our solar system. 
                      The sounds in Space Thrust were derived from recordings 
                      done by Dr. Fiorella Terenzi, an astrophysicist and composer, 
                      for her “Music of the Galaxies” CD. These recordings are 
                      of raw data, high frequency radio waves from Galaxy UGC 
                      6697 which resides approximately 180 million light years 
                      from earth. These radio waves, originally in the gigahertz 
                      frequency range, have been sub-divided many times to bring 
                      them into the range of human hearing. Reek will explain 
                      the how he realized the musical content of these unique 
                      sounds and created 11 unique instruments for utilization 
                      in this piece. Reek will also show some unique Prepared 
                      Piano samples he designed with Patrick Moraz for the John 
                      Cage Tribute CD, “A Chance Operation”.

                      Lyall <a href=http://www.envaren.org/envaren_art/><b>http://www.envaren.org/envaren_art/</b></a> 
                      is a locally-based artist "whose practice integrates scientific 
                      investigation, cultural taboos surrounding science and art, 
                      and social patterns which emerge from these areas. Unlike 
                      many artists currently working in relation to science, her 
                      work involves the use of scientific methodologies within 
                      an artistic domain. This often brings up issues surrounding 
                      the authority of science, and questions the exclusionary 
                      perspectives of one of our most valued cultural domains. 
                      Her work involves the appropriation of found scientific 
                      processes and searching for ways to identify the assumptions 
                      they contain. She is particularly interested in the mineral 
                      of bone, (hydroxyapitite), and has incorporated it into 
                      a 19th century electrochemical process commonly used for 
                      plating metals. Using this method, she creates formations 
                      which attach to biological structures, such as existing 
                      bones or the structural components of eggs. It was interesting 
                      to her to learn that similar material practices are currently 
                      being used in material science and biotechnology for the 
                      creation of miniature electronic circuits which can be grown 
                      and then reabsorbed in the body. Throughout history, people 
                      from different fields of study within the same culture are 
                      often attracted to the similar methods and materials. This 
                      simultaneity is not so mysterious as it is functional. It 
                      is often based on our current medical knowledge, intuition, 
                      and our technological development of apparatus for observing 
                      biological phenomena within our own bodies." </p>

                      Own Shadow’</i>: "On average, how much fun would you say 
                      you have with your own shadow? A modicum? A smidgen? None 
                      at all? If you're like many americans, you probably suffer 
                      from what is known as "uninteractus shadowitis", a severe 
                      condition of boredom brought on by the fact that your shadow 
                      doesn't play jump-rope with you, or let you be a super-model, 
                      or tend your garden, or even fly. But you will be happy 
                      to note that thanks to this year's Indie Game Jam, you can 
                      now do all those things and a whole lot more. </p>
                    <p> Each year in the spring, Chris Hecker and Sean Barrett 
                      invite professional video game developers from all over 
                      the country to come to a barn in Oakland, California for 
                      the four-day "Indie Game Jam". Each year there is a central 
                      technological theme, and the objective is to produce as 
                      many different, fully playable games as possible within 
                      that theme (and in only the four days allotted). This year's 
                      theme was "games you can play with your own shadow." The 
                      equipment necessary to play the games is quite simple: a 
                      firewire camera, a projector, and a computer. The projector 
                      projects the games onto a screen, and the player (or players) 
                      stands in between the projector and the screen, thus injecting 
                      their shadow into the game's display. The firewire camera 
                      continuously captures the screen and feeds the results back 
                      to the computer, which the game uses as input. So, quite 
                      literally, you play each and every game with your shadow 
                      - no mice, no keyboards, no gamepads :) </p>
                    <p> In this 30-minute DorkBot presentation, I will be demonstrating 
                      some selected games from the 14 playable ones we created. 
                      I'll give a brief overview of the system we used as a harness 
                      (called Shadow Garden), and I'll discuss the lessons we 
                      learned about designing interactivity around the novel input 
                      device that is a player's shadow. And, space permitting, 
                      we'll have a fully running version of a few of the games 
                      available for everyone to play into the wee hours of the 
                      night." </p>
