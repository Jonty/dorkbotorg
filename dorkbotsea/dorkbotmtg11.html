                      an Indymedia video collective in Seattle. He is producer 
                      of &quot;Indymedia Presents,&quot; a weekly public access 
                      show. Fridays at 9:30pm, Seattle (Channel 77) and King County 
                      (Channel 29) the show runs on on Bainbridge Island alternating 
                      nights at 11:30pm. The show is also aired in St. Paul, MN. 
                      Rowland curates the on-going Labor Films Screening Series, 
                      sponsored by the King County Laobr Council, the Harry Bridges 
                      Center For Labor Studies, IBEW Local 46, and PepperSpray 
                      Productions. His video work has appeared numerous times 
                      on Free Speech TV, the people&sup1;s national satelite channel 
                      (DISH network), and on Amy Goodman&sup1;s &quot;Democracy 
                      Now.&quot; Rowland&sup1;s articles have been published on 
                      more than one occasion in Z Magazine. During the run-up 
                      to Gulf War I, Rowland created the &quot;Real Hero&sup1;s 
                      Poster Project,&quot; producing scores of posters, each 
                      depicting a military resister to the Gulf War. The posters 
                      informally went up in cities around the country, with formal 
                      installations of the entire project in a half dozen cities. 
                      He also organized &quot;Gut Reaction,&quot; a national anti-war 
                      art show which hung for a month in the OK Hotel. In 1989, 
                      Rowland was the &quot;veteran who napalmed 1,000 US flags&quot; 
                      the moment it became illegal to burn the US flag. The case 
                      which resulted from that action prompted the Supreme Court 
                      to overturn Papa Bush&sup1;s flag burning law. In 1968, 
                      Rowland, along with other soldiers, was convicted of mutiny, 
                      in a highly publicized political trial where the anti Vietnam 
                      War mutineers became known as &quot;The Presidio 27.&quot;

                    <p><b>Mark Taylor-Canfield</b> is a well-known figure in the 
                      Seattle area. Sometimes controversial, he has always managed 
                      to stir up the political and arts scene and over the years 
                      he has developed a reputation for challenging the status 
                      quo. His arrest onstage during his own performance at Seattle 
                      Symphony&#146;s Benaroya Hall is the stuff of legend and 
                      has inspired performance art pieces, cartoons and numerous 
                      articles and essays. Mark had planned to protest the state 
                      of the arts in Seattle and the lack of public funding, specifically 
                      targeting the Mayor&#146;s Arts Task Force which never really 
                      accomplished anything to help local artists. In fact, Seattle 
                      Mayor Paul Schell had vetoed or shelved all of the group&#146;s 
                      proposals. In the ensuing controversy, Taylor-Canfield was 
                      arrested before he could actually perform the world premier 
                      of his solo piano piece, &#147;Catharsis&#148;, because 
                      of slanderous rumors that he planned to destroy the Symphony&#146;s 
                      expensive concert grand piano. He had denied the rumors 
                      all along, but someone decided he was just a little too 
                      political and the rest is history. Of course, no charges 
                      were ever filed since he broke no laws. All he did was step 
                      onto the stage. The film of his arrest, by the way, was 
                      featured on local news programs and the Seattle Weekly headlined 
                      their story, &#147;Composer Nabbed, Piano Saved&#148;.</p>

                    <p>Mark Taylor-Canfield also hosts programs on the Seattle 
                      Independent Media Network&#146;s Radio X. As an activist, 
                      Mark has been responsible for helping to organize large 
                      civil rights and anti-globalization demonstrations in the 
                      Seattle area. He is a founding member of the public interest 
                      civil rights group the Committee For Government Accountability 
                      and the multi-media arts group the Sonicabal. His work on 
                      civil rights issues has been recognized by community activists 
                      and by city officials. He has testified at many public hearings, 
                      including a statement before the Federal Communications 
                      Commission. He is co-author of two reports on civil rights 
                      which have been forwarded to the Center For Constitutional 
                      Rights at Rutgers University. </p>
