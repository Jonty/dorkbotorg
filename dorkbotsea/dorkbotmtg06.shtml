                    <p><b>Mark Bain</b>, <i>"Vibrating Buildings and Other Escapades"</i>: 
                      Amsterdam-based artist Mark Bain will be taking time out 
                      of a brief visit to Seattle, his home town, to discuss his 
                      work to date. In his own words, Mark “works on the interface 
                      of acoustics, architecture and actions of conceptual/experiential 
                      integration. For some time Bain has been involved in an 
                      ongoing research into the area of sound and architecture 
                      and how sonic events condition bodies and buildings they 
                      occupy. Other installations involve living systems and investigative 
                      devices that position the viewer into rarified experiences. 
                      In this work, he designs hybrid apparatuses that engage 
                      locations and the public. They are not necessarily products 
                      in themselves, but rather tools developed which lead to 
                      certain artistic ends. His research can be thought as a 
                      kind of divining, a loosening, a search for a living entity 
                      within that which is normally thought of as static and dead: 
                      architecture, structures, sites.”

                      Ghiradelli Square International Childrens' Art Center, where 
                      he displayed 'wire sketches', funny cars and shopping carts, 
                      figures from Saul Steinberg and Charles Scultz - "kid stuff" 
                      created from leftover scraps of leadwire taken from components 
                      he soldered into pc boards for his father when he was 12. 
                      Other career highlights include an interactive sound and 
                      light sculpture show called Softscience in 1985 at silkscreen 
                      collective Survival Graphics (Madison, WI), which was the 
                      first ever non-print based show held at that venue. A year 
                      later, Softscience became the name of Kevin's Amp Tech shop, 
                      which ran for the next 10 years. Kevin is a founder of Ballard's
