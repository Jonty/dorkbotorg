                          <p><b>Jack Dollhausen</b>, &#147;<i>I Would Rather That 
                            They Made You Dance</i>&#148;&#133; When told that 
                            his sculptures made an art critic think, Jack Dollhausen 
                            said &#147;I would rather that they made you dance&#148;. 
                            &#147;Think binary numbers. Think the multi-layered 
                            fugues of Bach. Think a chopped and channeled hot 
                            rod, old flying saucer movies, a pond cloudy with 
                            algae. Las Vegas odds, and the coolest magic you know, 
                            and the hardest mathematics. Now put those thoughts 
                            into motion, and you get a feeling of Jack Dollhausen&#146;s 
                            art. I never believed, actually believed, in electrons 
                            until I encountered this work. Granted, we&#146;re 
                            engaged in mad tangos with sub-atomic particles every 
                            instant, but Jack makes the cosmic dance visible&#133; 
                            &#147;All of my work comes from a pursuit of sound 
                            and light, movement and change, and unpredictable 
                            effects,&#148; Jack says. For thirty years, he has 
                            created light-space and sound-space, an invisible 
                            architecture surrounding each work; when a viewer 
                            breaks into that space, the piece responds in various 
                            ways. Thus, this art allows us to participate consciously 
                            in the perpetual, complex oscillations in the universe, 
                            an experience ranging from the merely startling to 
                            the downright psychedelic. In other words, here&#146;s 
                            your chance to flirt with radiant energy. And it flirts 
                            back.&#148; (From &#147;Persistence of Vision: the
