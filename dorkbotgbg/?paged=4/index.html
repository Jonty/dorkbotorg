<b>Presenters</b><br />
<a href="http://www.iftaf.org/">IFTAF (Institute for Transacoustic Research)</a> (AT) : The Institute for Transacoustic Research was founded in 1998 in Vienna to define and research transacoustics. Transacoustic research is concerned with the peripheral effects and tangential areas of acoustics, with their borders to other areas of research. Transacoustic research carries out science by means of art and art by means of science. The antiquated differentiation of these two areas is rejected and methods and settings from both areas are combined to arrive at unique lines of connection and division. IFTAF, which performs regularly at various electronic music festivals around the world with their custom-made musical instruments, will be represented here by Jörg Piringer (radio artist, sound poet, musician) and Ernst Reitermaier(experimental musician and radio art as well)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wickerwork.net/">Mattias Petersson</a> (SE) : Stockholm-based composer and sound artist Mattias Petersson&#8217;s music has been described as a mix between experimental electronica, electro-acoustic, industry and crackling noise. Since his debut album &#8220;Mimer&#8221; (Fylkingen Records, 2003), which was based upon sounds from a defunct iron mine, Petersson&#8217;s industrial soundscape has been mixed with clean waveforms, piano and orchestra samples, often treated through dirty filters and digital distortion. Mattias also released some music on his own label &#8220;Wickerwork Recordings&#8221;, and contributes with a track on the recently released MP3 compilation &#8220;The Post_piano2 Open Remix Project&#8221; on the label 12k. Besides working as solo artist he also collaborates with video artists and musician Fredrik Olofsson and many others, and plays his music around the world.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.daonk.org">Dånk! Collective </a>(SE) : Dånk! is a multidisciplinary collective based in Göteborg that works at the intersection of art, technology and design, with a particular focus on sound. The collective&#8217;s activities include art projects, HCI/Ubicomp research projects, organisation of events (Dorkbot, club nights, festivals, conferences, workshops), consulting in interaction design and new technologies, and freelance teaching in the context of seminars, participatory workshops, student supervision and more. Dånk! consists of Alexander Berman, Lalya Gaye, Olle Huge, Mappe Persson, Oscar Ramos, and Richard Widerberg.<br />
